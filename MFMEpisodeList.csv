Almost every year Peak Design releases some sort of iteration of an outdated piece of equipment and it SELLS. Last year they employed 38 people and did $70m in revenue. He owns 100% of it.

We hang out there so come join and let's talk ideas: www.facebook.com/groups/ourfirstmillion ** Amanda Bradford (@amandabradford) was 28 years old, in business school and using dating apps. She got tired of stalking every match on Linkedin, Facebook etc.. to see if they were legit. Why doesn’t the dating app do this for me?So against all her advisors advice, she started a dating app called the League that checks your Facebook & Linkedin to verify that you are who you say you are.Strange idea, but It’s kinda working! They have over 100k paying members, profitable & been around for 5 years. We talk about: how she got her first 400 users at launch, how they figured out if people would pay $$ for subscription and what the future of dating looks like.

#155 - NFTs Explained: How Digital Art Is Being Sold For Millions and What the Opportunities Are,"Sam Parr (@TheSamParr) and Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) discuss: Negotiation as a Service (NaaS) - The guys talk about (and maybe invent) a new category of business: negotiations as a service. The idea here is that there are certain big ticket items where a professional can negotiate a better price for the end consumer. - Incentives matter, however. For a Realtor, getting a client a better deal isn’t always in their best interest. A better model: the negotiator gets a designated percentage if they are able to negotiate below a set price. - Idea: Applying a better incentive model to real estate or home financing. Paying a skilled negotiator a fee for reducing your interest rate can result in thousands being saved annually. - Idea: Salary negotiations for both employee and employer. NFTs - NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique crypto tokens. Unlike say, Bitcoin, they aren’t mutually interchangeable -- each token is unique. In other words, NFTs are collectible. - NFTs have exploded in recent months. One site, https://cryptoslam.io/ (also https://defipulse.com/), tracks the daily transactions of different NFT. The top NFT, NBA Top Shots, does $46m worth of digital art transactions daily. - Shaan 10xd his money on the following piece in a matter of days. https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x8ae06a29a816580cbd069e460dd57c6c964bb3da/7500010105. - This piece alone https://cryptoslam.io/cryptopunks/mint/6487 sold for over $1m. - Artists like Eminem and shows like Rick and Morty are created pieces of content that’ll be sold as NFTs. - Logan Paul made $3.5m in one day selling nfts https://beincrypto.com/logan-paul-raises-3-5-million-in-one-day-from-nft-sales/. - Opportunity: When a goldrush is happening, sell shovels. Shaan and Sam think the shovels here are displays. People are buying NFTs, they are going to want to display them. The options at the moment are frames like https://infiniteobjects.com/ and https://www.netgear.com/home/digital-art-canvas/. On the pod Shaan estimates you can sell 300-400 frames and easily generate $5m in a month. - https://opensea.io/: Another marketplace for NFTs. This is the eBay of NFTs CoinMarketCap - CoinMarketCap is a displayed of crypto prices. It's a simple idea that has been working. - When they delisted South Korean cryptos without warning on Jan. 7th, the move wiped out $100 billion of total crypto asset market value. - They were acquired for a rumored $400 million.

"#156 - David Segal Talks Building a 9-Figure Tea Business, Decommoditizing Boring Products & The Future of Retail","Sam Parr (@TheSamParr), Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) and David Segal (@_davidsegal) discuss: David’s background - At 26, David teams up with his 70-something-year-old cousin, Herschel Segal, to start DAVIDsTEA. - Herschel had made his fortune in Canada’s fashion industry. Previously Davis was helping his Herschel make small investments. Together they saw an opportunity to grow a tea brand, where David led and Herschel invested - He made his first million when a Boston PE firm (Highland Capital) made an investment in DAVIDsTEA. - When the company went public it was doing $30m in EBITDA. He didn't want to sell shares at the time, but needed to in order to make the IPO big enough. He eventually left the business and sold his shares because of management issues. He sold at an average of $14 a share. - Today he runs a few businesses. One of which is a restaurant where he is trying to mix the best of ghost kitchens with a sitdown restaurant - David is currently trying to get back in the tea game. He sees an opportunity to make tea good, and cool again. Tea penetration is tiny in NA, so there is a lot of room to grow. - With his new brand he wants to do DTC business by keeping tea simple, but widening its appeal. - Previous to DAVIDsTEA, he ran a software business. It was essentially an abandoned cart business but for real life. Brainstorm - Idea: good video for online meetings is like what a nice Italian suit was in the 80s. It shows professionalism and class. Sam mentions he is willing to pay thousands to have someone create a turnkey video conference setup for him. He thinks this could be a great business opportunity. - Made Renovation (https://www.maderenovation.com/ founded by Roger Dickey) offers turnkey bathrooms. The idea is clients can select from a limited amount of pre-selected styles. Shaan suggests applying this same idea to video conferencing setups. - Idea: Uber for contractors. David suggests it’s hard finding reliable contractors, and there may be space for a company that can help organize the market better. - Modsy: For $500 per room, Modsy provides an on-demand interior designer. They will create a layout and make suggestions for furniture to use. - The guys discuss several “experts on-demand” companies. Companies like Intro.co, GLGinsights.com, Clarity.fm & Officehours.com all do similar things in different ways: connect users with experts on a variety of topics. - Idea: Decommoditizing everyday stuff. By taking an everyday item and adding a unique element to it, you can charge more and differentiate an otherwise commodity. David brings up Duraflame. Duraflame is a fast lighting fire log. The company does 9 figures in revenue but hasn’t been innovated upon in years. Homesick Candles successfully innovated on candles by adding regional scents and creating a differentiated product. Eric Ryan built his career doing this with Method, Olly, and Welly. - Idea: Firelogs with scents. Decommoditizing a boring product like fire logs with a viral and catchy twist. - Idea: “...For dummies 2.0”. The “...For Dummies” were a popular series of books educating anyone on any topic. Both David and Shaan are bullish on doing the same for complex modern topics like blockchain or NFT. But doing so through viral videos. - Idea: Using stores as showrooms. David nearly started a company just like this. It’s a massive opportunity for whoever can figure out how to make use of retail space in a way that makes sense in the ecom age. A company doing this is b8ta. - Smart Center: David mentions Smart Center and other REITS have been big winners during the pandemic, by converting abandoned retail space into apartments, senior living etc. - WGSN (https://www.wgsn.com/en/): A subscription service that helps businesses understand the biggest trends in just about every sector.

"#157 - Instagram Food Drops Making $200k a Week, Chrome Extensions That are Crushing It & Open Salaries","MFM #157



Rewarding hustle: MFM is hiring two kids to do video production because they took the job without permission. They heard Sam complain about needing a recording studio and offered to do the work https://twitter.com/DylanJardon/status/1366274333858017282?s=20. 

This is how you get the job you want. Don’t send a resume. Do the work instead. Don’t ask for permission.


Food topics


The food companies of Instagram: Companies mycookiedealer.com, 1-900-Ice-Cream, and Allie’s Banana Bread are crushing it on IG with food drops that sell out in seconds.


Why it’s big: These work because it’s at the intersection of many trends: cloud kitchens (no need for expensive restaurant infrastructure), DTC (no need to get costly distribution deals and shelf space) and have virality baked into them.


My Cookie Dealer is estimated to be doing $200k per weekly drop. This is a potential $10m business today.


Formula: Sam breaks down how these companies are going viral, and how you can copy.

Make a side ingredient the main thing (cheese, cookie dough)

Make it in an unusual color (rainbow bagel, rainbow kettle cork, green ketchup, cloud bread)

Make it huge (huge sundae, massive pizza cookie, sushi-rito, massive KitKat)

Frankenfood: combine two different foods (cronut, pancake cereal, donut cereal, cream cheese, bell pepper, desert burger, ramen burger, spaghetti donuts, fairy bread)

Food allergy or remove stuff from it (vega ice cream, Banza)

Make junk food or simple food ultra-fancy (tater tots, mozzarella sticks)


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IFYt20QON8 


Tiller money


Spreadsheet plugins: The guys have talked Chrome plugins and browser extensions in the past, but an overlooked niche is spreadsheet plugins.

Plugins are great businesses because they are sticky and capitalize on an existing platform and user base. They can be light, simple tools that can gain huge adoption quickly. 


Tiller Money (https://www.tillerhq.com/): Personal finance nerd Sam loves the simplicity of this plugin. Most people already manage their money on a spreadsheet, Tiller Money just makes it easier to do so.


Supermetrics (https://supermetrics.com/): Marketing data plugin Sam uses. He predicts the business does 8-figures in revenue.


Open salaries


Open salaries: Should companies publish employee salaries? Open salary data is becoming a legal requirement, starting with 🍃 Colorado: ""From 2021 employers must disclose pay rates or ranges in job postings for jobs that could be worked in Colorado (including remote)"" Source


Open salaries is part of the culture of some companies. Buffer used it as a growth hack. The company continues to publish a lot of it’s financials and all employee salaries.

Companies doing it now:

Glassdoor shows average and anonymous salaries but can be inaccurate They were acquired for $1.2B in 2018. At the time did $170m in revenue with 700 employees 

Founded by Rich Barton (we’ve spoken about him a few times before). Famous for saying “Information wants to be free”. Started Zillow, Expedia, and Glassdoor off this principle.


Levels.fyi: A helpful guide to understanding what employees at top tech firms should be making. They even help you negotiate a salary. 


Take: Open salaries tend to benefit employees (more transparency means higher, more equal pay) and is more detrimental to employers.

Apple stopped doing it. Buffer has also said it’s not helpful anymore and was only good for initial growth.


Pat Flynn published his income for several years, but eventually stopped as he started getting hate.

"#158 - Buying Michael Jordan's House (and Making a Profit), Investing in Athletes & Successful Startup-Studios","MFM #158

Andrew Chen story

University of Washington has a program for gifted high schoolers who want to do college early. Andrew took part and graduated at 19.

He met some pretty cool people doing this including emmit of twitch, and head of hedge funds.

Shaan got into a Duke program as a teenager via TIP program by scoring high on PSAT. Shaan: This is a great marketing trick -- he’ll do this when he starts his school

For athletics, the opposite is done.


MJ’s house

Michael Jordan’s Chicago home went on sale for $30m many years ago, but hasn’t sold. Today it’s on sale for $14m.


Idea #1: Buy the house using crowdfunding and through NFTs, any fan can own a fraction of the property. From there, the property can be turned into a museum.


Idea #2: Instead of turning the house into a museum, turn into a great Airbnb. Obama’s Hawaii house (the Plantation Estate) rents for $6k a night or $180k a month.

You have to make it the dream “man cave”/sports fan getaway. Make it an alternative to Vegas for bachelor’s parties. Fill the house with Jordan memorabilia, and make it an incredible experience for fans to come to.


Famous homes: There's a precedent for taking famous homes and turning them into museums. 


Graceland: Elvis’ former home receives 600k visitors each paying ~$30


Painted Ladies: Painted Ladies and “Full House” house are mainstay attractions. “Full House” house sold for a premium above market price. 


Counter: Sam is sceptical of crowdfunding on Rally Road because of the difficulty in liquidating. Shaan counters by saying fractional ownership makes liquidity less of an issue. Also many aren’t concerned about selling. Would rather wait and hold.


Big League Advance


BLA: Offers cash to minor league baseball players with the promise of making money if the baseball player hits it big.

Fernando Tatis Jr: Took cash when he was in the minors from BLA, but now has to pay out ~$30m after signing a $300m+ deal


Opportunity: Baseball is the easiest to model, but the NBA presents a great opportunity because of guaranteed contracts. If a player gets a $100m, 5 year deal, you can offer them $80m upfront for the contract. Instead of 


Counter: This is a risky business. The business only works if you can model properly and get big hits to cover the losses.


Startup studio

Instead of investing in companies or starting just one company, startup studios invest and incubate several businesses at once.

Shaan: Historically very tough and didn’t work. Garret Camp, Mark Pincus, Kevin Rose, and Michael Birch (Monkey Inferno where Shaan worked) all had studios which had no big winners.


Successful studios: The tides may be shifting as a few studios have begun getting hits. Thrive Capital by Josh Kushner (Oscar), Atomic by Jack Abraham (Hims), Prehype (Barkbox and Ro)


Atomic: Only works at one project at a time and the team has 9 months to raise a series A or else may be out of a job. Also focused more on B2B than consumer.

eFounders: European studio that only does SaaS. They’ve been able to make the model successful


Kevin Ryan: Part of DoubleClick when it was sold. Made about $20m and created AlleyCorp which incubated companies like MongoDB, Business Insider, Zola and Guilt.


Good: It’s a dream job because you work on multiple ideas. Unlike a traditional startup, when failure happens you can just move onto a new project as a team


Bad: For a startup to work, you need laser focus. Often what happens, when a startup hits a plateau, you can pivot to an area that’s working. At studios, the team is more inclined to move onto another project altogether. No do-or-die, back-to-the-wall mentality as with startups.

"#159 - Update on Michael Jordan's House, a Nine Figure Sex Toy Company & the Man with a Million Acres","MFM #159

MJ house update


Recap: Last episode the guys spoke about buying MJ’s house. The plan was to potentially turn it into a museum or Airbnb.


Problem: zoning and parking -- but those might be overcome 

Shaan: Spoke to Rally Rd and Nifty Gateway founders 


Now what: What's going to happen now?

Sam thinks nothing’s going to happen -- the guys are too busy. Shaan: you’re afraid to fail


Collecting old Apple computers


Opportunity: Old Apple computers like the Macintosh II and Apple II sell for a premium on eBay. There is still demand for these because of their cool aesthetics, and retro look.

At Monkey Inferno, visitors would often ask about their old Macs over the expensive paintings that hung on the walls.

Sam bets these will continue to appreciate. Can make for a good investment opportunity as retro style becomes more and more in demand. 


Idea: Creating products from old Macs, such as https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2012/03/Macquarium-jake-harms.jpg 


Sex talk


Steve Shubin - founded Interactive Life Forms: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleshlight



Origin: Steve started creating sex dolls, but eventually realized most guys wouldn’t order sex dolls. He pivoted and created the Fleshlight. He scaled the company with his kids.

Does an estimated $50-$100m in revenue


Sidenote: One of Fleshlight’s factories in Spain uses its excess capacity to manufacture prosthetics elephant legs for Southeast Asia


Opportunity: Creating the new fleshlight

There is a growing demand for male sex toys, especially in countries like India and China. Even in areas where it’s taboo, new discreet packaging has made it easier. 


Idea: Fleshlight marketing through channels like Onlyfans. Molds can even be made from the Onlyfans creators themselves.


Billy of the week

Brad Kelley

Started out renting space for factories and warehouses. When he noticed lots of customers using his warehousing space to store tobacco, he pivoted. 

He founded Commonwealth Brands in 1991 and sold it in 2001 for $1B

""I've never defended [smoking]. Hopefully, it will be phased out of society.""

He’s bought a ton of land since then and is now the 4th largest landowner in the US.

In January 2020, Kelley put up for sale many of his West Texas ranches, offering roughly 500,000 acres with a listing price of $404 million.

He also bought Lonely Planet installing a 24-year-old CEO at the helm

The purchase was a failure when he sold the company in 2020 for $50m having had bought it for $70m

Sam’s a fan

Keeps to himself and has done “boring” businesses. In contrast to Silicon Valley’s flashy hype-machine


Indie VC


Indie VC was a venture firm backing mostly bootstrapped founders. The idea was to give founders a little bit of money to help them grow instead of the traditional model of flooding a company with cash and taking a massive stake.

The company closed its doors, and Shaan and Sam are critical of how founder Bryce Roberts announced the closing (didn’t take the blame hard enough). https://medium.com/@bryce/the-end-of-indie-6e1b92d90b09

"#160 - Paid Communities Making $20m+ (and How to Build One), Fighting Inertia & An Interview With Dave Selinger of Deep Sentinel","MFM #160

The guys breakdown paid communities

Why paid communities are good businesses:

You can make them kinda fast (much faster if you have an audience)

Fun to run if you like the interest

Don’t need a lot of start-up capital and can have a lean team

Quite profitable

Cons:

Churn can be high

Likely can’t scale to me huge

Won’t get better with size necessarily (if user content-driven, deal-driven, or otherwise, more can be better. If connection related, less is better)

Seem challenging to sell if there’s a leader

To make a successful community:

The amount of money you’ll make is directly proportional to the amount of revenue the members will make being connected to each other multiplied by the amount of people who’d sign up.

Enthusiasts of RC cars? Likely don’t make much value from it, so you can’t charge a lot. But if it’s huge (and get better with size) then can work

Underdog, us vs them, united interests, info that wants to be private, highly disjointed online, 


Communities the guys like:
Tiger21: A peer group for people above with a net worth of at least $10m. 


Numbers: It boasts ~850 members. They generate revenue through a $30,000 membership fee and also run ads to its members. Do an estimated $24m at least in sales

Sold to private equity recently


Why join?: Learn and make connections.

Evanta

Was known as CXO Acquisition Co. and Sports Leadership Acquisition Co...so maybe started in sports?

Evanta derives most of its revenue from event sponsorship. Event sponsors pay a fee to advertise at each event with pricing dependent upon the quality and level of executive attendance.

121 Unique communities worldwide 6,500 Participating organizations 253 C-level programs across 10 countries 83% of Fortune 100 represented 18,000 Participating C-level executives 87% companies with revenue of $1B+

Sold for $275m in 2016 to CEB and then Gartner

Had $17m in cash when bought

12x income...so made $23m in profit!

SoleSavvy

A SoleSavy membership provides you the tools and resources you need to successfully purchase the products you want for retail (starting with sneakers)

Raised $2m

Started as a Slack group (the waitlist for the group grows by 400 people per day)

5,000 members. They charge $33 a month so $160k MRR

Cook groups. AK Chef is a big one. 2000 ish members at $50.

NurseLifeRN

Instagram meme page with 1.2m followers

BALA (a shoe for nurses company) uses this as the main advertising channel.

Shaan predicts these niche communities can launch brands and hold equity in companies who need their captive audience to grow.


Inertia

Shaan explains inertia:


Are you doing what you are doing just because or does it make you happy and are you chasing what you actually want

Greatest Hits #1 - Turning it Around: From Failure to a $100m+ Success,"Suli Ali is one of the most interesting founders we’ve had on the pod.
Suli and his brother Moiz have started and sold $300m worth of companies. They’ve also invested in hundreds of big-name startups, thousands of real estate deals, and much more more.
He built small, silly apps. Like a Facebook app survey where you voted “most likely to wear a bunny costume”. Yet...it turned into a huge success. How?
When he sold his first company, it was doing $85 million in revenue and $15 million in profit.
In this episode, we discuss his journey from making $76k a year at Microsoft to selling his first company for $100,000,000+.

So sit back, grab a salad (cause we're healthy in 2020) and enjoy this conversation.
