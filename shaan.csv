"0:00:00 Shaan: He needs a hold me back guy. You're at a hold me back guy, you're in a fight, and you're like, hey, listen, I'm gonna go after these guys. I need you to hold me back. So I'm not actually trying to fight this guy. I need it to look like I'm trying to fight this guy, and I need you to hold me back. And it's gotta be, ah, if these guys weren't holding me, I would have kicked your ass. He needs to find a hold me back.",no
0:00:25 Shaan: I feel like I can rule the world. I know I could be what I want to put my all in it. Like no days off on the road. Let's try.,no
"0:00:33 Shaan: right. We are live. What's going on? Dude, amazing hoodie. Sick hoodie.",no
0:00:41 Shaan: That is very nice.,no
"0:00:54 Shaan: You're a stressful dude to organize an event for. I've never had to do it, but I've been a part of events where people are organizing for us. And I'm like, they're like, oh, yeah, by the way, it's everything, you know, the venue changed. And we forgot, you know, there's only one chair on stage. I'm like, it's cool. All right, no, no problem. And then you're like, what the hell? So I would be very stressed if I had to throw a offsite or an event where you were my like kind of core customer. Is that fair?",yes
0:01:52 Shaan: it is. That was a good reason.,no
"0:02:16 Shaan: Trey Lockerbie Yeah, I think that's true for sure. And do you find yourself thinking bigger as a kind of like the way bigger now? This is you've got one win under your belt. What was the phrase that Justin Mayer said? Once you do whatever you got to do to get your nut and after that go for your noble mission. So you've gotten your nut now, you're financially secure, you're safe. Not only are you calmer, but are you more, I don't know, ambitious or long-term oriented in some way?",no
"0:03:33 Shaan: Yeah, the way I think about it is like, because you see examples on both sides. You see when somebody had no other option back against the wall, that's when they when they when they rose to the occasion. And you can also hear the other other scenario, which is because I was secure, I was able to play a long-term game and I was less emotionally invested in the ups and downs of it, therefore I was able to make better decisions, and blah, blah, blah. And you could see both examples, so which one is it? And actually, I think the reality is that success is not based on either one of those. It's not based on how much money you had in your bank account, when you had zero, or when you had a bunch. People tell themselves stories about it either way. I think fundamentally, if a person is driven, intrinsically driven, it doesn't matter whether that fuel is because they're a technologist and they just love technology, they're trying to make something good for humanity, or they're insecure because, you know, in seventh grade, Rachel dumped them, and it's like, well, either way, it doesn't matter. You know, like, it doesn't matter what your driving force is, as long as you have a driving force. And it's different for a whole bunch of people. There's examples of people with all kinds of chips on their shoulder. I think you do need to be driven and it's just a question of by what. And I think everybody's got",no
"0:04:46 Shaan: I'm definitely more calm, but I was pretty calm before. I said calm, I would say is not really the word. I guess the way I would put it is I'm less desperate. And I think that has ups and downs. Again, like I said, like when I was desperate to prove myself, Like you saw that I worked in that really fancy office. I also slept in that office I think basically I was like one year is like 275 days out of the year. I slept there and like it was nice to sleep there. It's a really nice they had an apartment built into the office so it wasn't like the it's not like I was sleeping under my desk on the like concrete floor, but nonetheless, that just sort of means I just didn't have a life. I didn't want to have a life. I didn't want to care about friends and dating and other things. I cared about just making it. I just wanted to be successful really badly. And I was like, it's not even that I was super productive all those hours, but I was like, look, I'm going to throw all my hours at the problem. I will sleep here. I will wake up here. That just seems more efficient. I'm just going to do that. I did that for several years. But now I would say that desperation has been replaced with a different asset. Okay, I lost the desperation, which was serving me. What do I have now? Which is like, I can operate more out of a like I can choose things that are like I'm actually driven towards like to have a purpose, even if there's no short",yes
"0:06:01 Shaan: Yeah, there's no short term path to like right now. For example, I'm writing this newsletter every day. I write this thing every day. There's no ads.",no
"0:06:11 Shaan: Yeah, just small boy. Small boy and I'm writing this thing. There's no ads. There's no premium. There's no upsell. There's no business model. So why am I doing it? And I'm like, because I really like writing and more than I like writing, I like finding interesting shit to write about things that, you know, scratch my curiosity. So I'm able to do something. And then as I'm doing this thing that has no business plan, that has no whatever, I'm seeing all these extra opportunities open up because that I couldn't have seen at the beginning. And so just by doing the thing I really kind of have drawn to, I'm most interested in, I'm doing my best work. And when I'm doing my best work, these unforeseen things start to open themselves up. And I'm like, oh, I would have the 24 year old me would have never been able to do this because 24 year old me was desperate and he did. I needed a payoff quick. Now I don't need a quick payoff. And so I'm able to do things differently. And I think that has a different advantage.",yes
"0:07:18 Shaan: No, no, no. My wife is not aware of it, but she's like, hmm, how come he's looking at his phone for like an extra 30 seconds longer? And it's because I'm coming up with a badass slam in my head. What's actually happening? I'm worth smithing a seventh grade insult right now. And I don't know, what does my kid want? What do you want? Hold on, daddy's busy. I'm coming up with a yo mama joke to Jason Calacanis right now.",no
"0:07:59 Shaan: $100, 000",no
"0:08:20 Shaan: Well, I don't know if he, so the background is while we were, I forgot what we were talking about. I think we were making fun of him a little bit because he, um, in the Rogan debate, people were like, you know, it's raised $2 million for this, the scientist to come debate this guy like a kind of a famous internet challenge here. And he's like, I'm in for 10k, which is funny because the answer the record doing was 100k plus.",yes
"0:08:55 Shaan: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine. I, by the way, I like Jason for the record. I have nothing against Jason Calacanis. I've listened to this week of startups for a long time. I don't listen anymore, but I used to listen like back in the day. I like the all-in podcast. It's sort of like two thoughts that are both true. I like their content. I have nothing against them personally. I've met him a couple of times in passing. No ill will there. Also, I think some things he says are funny and cringy, like funny kind of laugh at you, not with you type of thing and cringy. Like when the thing I think the joke I had made that he didn't like was that I said all in his billionaires talking about billionaire shit, MFM is millionaires talking about millionaire shit. And somebody goes actually it's more like three billionaires and their friend, Jason Calacanis. And he goes, he came in for his own defense and goes, actually, I'm a centi million centi millionaire. I just thought that was cringes. Which, objectively and scientifically it is. And so I think he might have might have taken offense to that and I didn't fully like it, but I would say my poker challenge to them is only for fun. I just think it would be a fun thing to do. I think it'd be a fun thing to watch. I'm just looking for some action. I love playing poker. They say they're great at poker. Okay, let's do a little celebrity challenge.",yes
"0:10:11 Shaan: Well, they didn't take the bait. I think, you know, he was sort of just like, well, you know, you're not famous enough for me to do this challenge. I have more to lose than I do. And I have to gain out of doing this was sort of the vibe I got, which honestly,",no
0:10:29 Shaan: for sure.,no
0:10:34 Shaan: in the stadium.,no
0:10:45 Shaan: You know,no
"0:10:46 Shaan: Yeah, yeah. But the funny thing is, as I was talking about, you know, we should like on the podcast, I was joking. I was like, oh, wait, is this fake internet beef? I would love to have some fake internet beef. That's, you know, this is how rappers for generations have been getting famous. You know, they just have fake beef. We should do this as podcasters with other podcasts. And so I think that was the fun behind it. We got one-upped big time. Just when I thought me and Jason Calacanis were getting some fake internet beef, Palmer Lucky comes off the top rope. The founder of Oculus and Andrew comes off the top rope and just body slams Jason. People love that. And then while that's going on, Elon Musk challenges Mark Zuckerberg to a fight. And now I don't even give a shit about my own poker match. I need to see these guys fight. Let's break this down. We have to do this story.",yes
"0:11:47 Shaan: Well, there's a few steps to it. So I think the first thing was, I guess the old, I think the origin of this was. A presentation leaked out of Facebook that was talking about the Facebook's coming out with a Twitter competitor. I think it's called project 92 or something like that. And it's a Twitter competitor and their pitch was sort of like, yeah, it's a Twitter competitor. Instagram people will be able to immediately have their Instagram following on this. So if you wanna, if you're already famous on Instagram, you could just start sharing short form text like Twitter on our new thing. And it will be run in a sane way. Like it'll be managed in a sane way, I think was the something that something with the word sane in it. And so essentially implying that Twitter is sort of insane. And either way, Elon's running it is reckless. So that got out that that present internal presentation leaked, maybe intentionally, maybe not. I don't know. So Elon started making fun of Zuckerberg. He's saying like, you know, suck my blink, you know, like, you know, he's just sort of like, you know, tweeting stuff like that. And then somebody, somebody was like, you know, watch out. Zuck's been training and he got an Elon replies and says I'll fight Zuck in a cage match so he says this and Zuck screenshots it and post on his Instagram story with the caption Send me location which for those who don't know is a iconic UFC slogan by Khabib. I think one of the greatest UFC fighters of all time who was when he was fighting with Conor McGregor and McGregor was like, oh, he's scared. He doesn't want to fight me, blah, blah, blah. And Habib just goes, brother, I'm not scared. You want to fight me? Okay, just send me location. Just send me location. Like basically, where do I need to go? I'll fight you anywhere. And so Zuck hits Elon with the send me location. And this triggers a chain of events that I thought was a joke. So I thought, first of all, I've never seen Zuck talk trash. That was already kind of an amazing moment. He did a heel turn, which is awesome. The second thing is, I was like, okay, well, there's no way this is serious. And then Elon sees that tweet and goes, or sees that story and goes, I'm serious. I'll do it if he's down. And then people are like, wait, what? I don't know if you saw this today, Sam. Do you see that Dana White's involved? So Dana White, who's the president of the UFC comes out. Cause again, I'm sort of, you know, my greatest fantasy would come true if this, if randomly two tech billionaire CEOs went and decided to do a UFC match, that's my two worlds colliding. All of a sudden Dana White comes out and he says, I talked to Mark and Elon last night. Both guys are absolutely dead serious about this. He goes, this would be the biggest fight of all time. Floyd and Connor was one of the biggest fights of all time. This I think triples it. There is no limit on how much this could make. He said it would be in Las Vegas, it would pay-per-view and it would be about a hundred bucks pay-per-view. And you would have 51 year old Elon Musk against I don't know, like 39 year old Mark Zuckerberg, who's a hundred pounds lighter than him. And dude, what is happening? Is this, is this real?",no
"0:16:22 Shaan: I have some rapid fire questions. Topic number one, most importantly, do you believe this will happen? Yes or no, and why?",no
0:16:42 Shaan: you think it's a no no because Elon,no
"0:16:45 Shaan: I 100% agree with you. I hope it happens. I'm not saying it won't happen, but I would just if I had to guess I had to guess I would say it doesn't happen because Elon realizes that he's going to lose a lot. He's going to lose first of all, if he does that",no
"0:17:01 Shaan: He's going to get tapped out. And if he, if he does it, I think he realizes that it's a pretty bad look for him to lose to suck. His cool factor is really high and he needs to find a wiggle out. He needs a hold me back guy. You're at a hold me back guy. You're in a fight. You're like, hey, listen, I'm gonna go after these guys I need you to hold me back. So I'm not I'm not actually trying to fight this guy I need it to look like I'm trying to fight this guy and I need you to hold me back and I it's gotta be off These guys weren't holding me. I would have kicked your ass. He needs to find a hold me back",no
"0:17:43 Shaan: winner by Noogie mark. All right. So that's my second question, which is how do you think let's say, let's say our dreams do come true. This fight does happen. What do you think would actually happen? Like predict the actual fight? What would happen? Fight starts. What happens?",no
0:18:29 Shaan: Yes. Now the counter argument would be but Elon could train. Are you counting Elon out? This guy's proven he could do anything. He could train. What's the counter to that?,no
0:18:46 Shaan: The magic powers of Ozempic. He's already on his epic. He's already lost like 30 pounds on Ozempic.,no
"0:19:01 Shaan: Here's some extra data. People on Twitter were like, Elon, we love you, but man, I think Zach would handle you. Here's what Elon said. Here are three things that he said.",no
"0:19:10 Shaan: Number one, he said, I don't work out except for sometimes when I pick my kids up and throw them in the air. So he doesn't work out at all. He doesn't exercise. Forget about fighting. The guy doesn't exercise. Secondly, he's like, I'm so much bigger than the guy, you know, just for reference, Elon's like six, three, 200 plus pounds. You know, Zuck is probably five, nine, I think five, five, eight, five, nine, maybe five, 10 max. And it's probably giving up easily 50 pounds in a, in a fight here. So weight classes do matter. And Elon says, I have this move called the walrus. Uh, yeah, I'm just like a walrus. I'll just lay on them. They can't do anything. They're just pinned. This is, this is his plan.",no
0:19:53 Shaan: It doesn't matter what he does. Jiu jitsu people want to start on their back with you on top of them.,no
"0:20:09 Shaan: way training. Like if you're a beginner in jujitsu, you can go to a jujitsu gym for six months and you'll still be getting your ass whooped by like, you know, people who are just like, you know, one year ahead of you because the learning curve is very steep to actually get good at this stuff. Like you don't pick up boxing or jujitsu very quickly. Boxing. I don't even think it would be a factor. I think the fight's going to the ground, both guys are too uncoordinated, nobody's knocking anyone out. Both guys I think would look very unathletic and would end in Zuck tapping him out. By the way, do you see this picture I put in the doc? Look at this, the picture of Elon wrestling a sumo wrestler. You seen this?",no
"0:20:47 Shaan: He said he's briefly done karate, briefly done judo, and had done a little bit of jiu-jitsu, is what Elon has said in the past.",no
"0:21:13 Shaan: I'm a good hang. I think a lot of people would pick Elon. I think Elon's looser and more fun. And it's like, oh, he smoked weed with Joe Rogan. He must be awesome. Right? Like this is like how most",no
"0:21:30 Shaan: Dude, They're both podium on the in the awkward Olympics. I mean, let's be real here.",no
"0:21:49 Shaan: I agree. I really hope this happens. There's this Dana White thing gave me a slight hope, but there's a famous people don't know this. Dana White is a like he's a world class liar. In fact, if you ever go into like the UFC communities on Reddit, whatever, like one of the most famous like taglines of the community is don't believe his lies because he'll tell you he'll sell you anything. He's a promoter. He will he will try to drum up interest doing whatever he's got to do and try to pull things off like that. This might be, by the way, this might be the Hail Mary, save Twitter thing. Mayweather McGregor did like $500 million. If he thinks this is going to do triple that, let's just pretend Dana White's not lying for a second here. If this fight did like a billion dollars and Elon took home, you know, 200 million dollars out of that net, hey, that's, you know, just another few months of runway for Twitter, which is currently unprofitable. And, you know, depending on who you believe, could be bleeding advertisers.",no
"0:22:57 Shaan: what billionaires do. They're gonna just send in like a proxy. Like here's my bodyguard versus yours. Right? Like in history, isn't this how like conquerors fight? They don't go fight themselves. They send in their best gladiator, like the top engineer at Facebook at the top engineer at Tesla need to go in and fight for their honor.",no
"0:23:18 Shaan: Yeah, let's do it.",no
"0:23:20 Shaan: All right. So what is beehive? Beehive is a piece of software. If you want to create an email newsletter, beehive, in my opinion, is the best way to do it. I'm biased because I invested in it, but I also used it before I invested in it. We used it for the milk road. We built our whole business off this. I basically saw what you had done with the hustle, what the morning group guys had done, and you guys had all done almost like what I'll call like the homebrew version of beehive, which was like, when I asked you, I said, hey, what should I use for this? You're like, well, you know, you're going to hear some things you care about. You care about deliverability. You care about how easy it is for your writers to write. You care about a referral program, blah, blah, blah. There's five tools. And what Beehive was, was",yes
"0:23:59 Shaan: and it's complicated and It's expensive. And what Beehive did instead was the guy worked at Morning Brew and he built out their referral and growth program, I think. He left and he basically was like, how do I productize the internal tech that we kind of had at Morning Brew so that it makes it easier for anybody to create a newsletter brand.",yes
"0:24:55 Shaan: So he spins it out. He creates Beehive. It's basically you go on, you click a few buttons, you got a newsletter, you got your templates, you can create segments, you can do all the features of a newsletter. Great. It's good. We use it for the milk road. We build our whole business off this thing. We sell milk road after a year or so along the way. I got pitched by him probably when you did. It was like, hey, I'm thinking about this be hype thing. We're raising money. Big fans. You guys would love for to have you involved. And I had the same opinion as you. I was like, I don't know, seem small. It's like I think I think there's some newsletter brands. I will be big, but I don't know if their underlying tech is going to be that big. I don't know if there's I don't know how big that platform would be as a software. So we passed and I think the first valuation we looked at was maybe 10 million. And you passed two at that time, right? For the same reason, market might be too small.",yes
"0:25:49 Shaan: And there's a classic lesson here, which is like, sometimes there's such a thing as knowing too much. Often, the people who know the most about an industry are either a too much scar tissue, they just don't want to be involved anymore. They just want to go do other things. They just don't want to think about that because there's too much like I spent seven years. I left a piece of my soul over there and I don't really want to want to worry about that again. And the other is you get too defined by like, you know, how things are and you don't really see you're almost too too deep in. You don't see where it's going. This is why very few breakthrough innovations come from. Traditional industry experts. They come from often beginners and why, why would a beginner be able to create a breakthrough and not an expert because they come in with a fresh perspective and a blank slate, they don't, they're not limited by, you know, the prevailing wisdom. So that's, that's happened many times over. So we pass, we start using it though. I'm like, I'll be a user. So, you know, there's that. I'm not going to invest, but I'll be a user. So we start using it.",no
"0:26:43 Shaan: And at first it was good, but I kept running into these limitations and I would be like, Hey, oh my God, they don't even let you filter by X or wait, you don't even have analytics for my growth side or the referral program only does this, you know, like I would find these, I'd bump into the limitations. This was very early on. We were like one of their first users, I think.",yes
"0:27:04 Shaan: It was the perfect replies always, which is, I hear you. We agree. Already working on it. But let me see if I can get you something a little sooner. You know, we're planning to release this in two months, but let me see what I can do here. And what they would do is either he would manually do a work around for us. It'd be like, look, we don't have this analytics thing yet, but here's what I'm going to do. I put a button on your dashboard. It's ugly. It's gray. Nobody else can see it. It just but it's an export. It'll email you a CSV. And then can you just run the run the analytics yourself for now until we build it? So he would give me a he would take three hours and just make my life better. He would understand he would also ask me a bunch of questions like, so what are you trying to really do here? And Let me just confirm I understand this like a good product person would do. He's trying to really understand the needs. The second thing he would do is then they would actually ship the feature. So when you'd say that's two weeks away, I remember telling Ben many times. Then be like, oh yeah, they said they're coming out in two weeks. I was like, dude, Are you a rookie? Like no way startups say anything. They don't like know what engineer has ever hit a timeline like this never happens. Sure enough, two weeks later, hey, they would proactively reach out. Hey, the features out, test it out. I want you to, I think it'll work for you guys now. And we would go do it. And he just did that three times. So over the course of about three or four months, I was like, change my mind, call Tyler, we need to invest in this thing. I was like, but what about your concerns about the market? I was like, I don't know, still might be true. But here's what I do know. This guy's an animal, he's making a product that's really good. And you know what? This might be an example where the market is bigger than you think, which has been the case for many big winners. Like, you know, what's the market for, you know, private black town car on demand or crashing on someone's house as an Airbnb, right? Like these things can become a lot bigger than you sort of initially look at if you sort of squint.",yes
"0:29:06 Shaan: And this is, so two things on this one, there's a framework that we had in my very first startup. We realized this, we were in the, we were doing that sushi restaurant and in the restaurant industry, there's this weird phenomenon, which is provide what's expected, no points, Mess up their order minus 10 points, but fix the mess up plus five points. So it's like I was like, hold up. If we had just given them the right dish, they don't care. There's as move on as expected. If we mess up their order, they're angry. But if we fast fix and we not just fix their order, but we give them the freebie with it, or we really make come back and make sure that they're all good, or we take it off their bill. All of a sudden they had a tremendous experience with us and they'll go tell their friends. And I was like, what's with that? And I came up with this sort of like the fix it theory of restaurants, which is actually mistakes, they're gonna happen anyways. And actually what you need to train instead of mistake minimization, it's how fast and how thoroughly can you fix it? Because that actually creates like a higher net promoter score.",yes
0:30:09 Shaan: This guy's doing this with software basically.,no
"0:30:12 Shaan: Yeah, I'm sure there's some name for this. I don't know. This was like a whatever, or discovered by some hard way. But like, I'm sure there's a fancy name for that. I just called it the fix it theory, right? Like if we fix it, it's all about how you fix it. And the fix it's where you get the like diehards. So it's",yes
"0:30:26 Shaan: I noticed that. And so he was doing that. I'll give you one other little beehive story, which is like a little dark. Maybe doesn't want me to share this, but like, you know, at some point his CTO passed away. So we were a biggest jerk of all time. He says the two week thing something didn't happen in the two weeks one time and I was like, dude, come on, you said whatever. Where's that feature? We really need it. Don't you understand how important my newsletter bubble? I'm being like, you know, I didn't say those words, but like, I'm playing it up in a way here. We were just like, oh, God, complaining like it's not ready yet. He's like, I'm so sorry. We're just dealing with something right now. His co-founder or CTO had passed away during the startup and they were, you know, that's a very hard thing for any entrepreneur to deal with. He handled that like as well as a human being can handle it, meaning was totally, you know, like gracious and empathetic around what was going on. But also understood that like, you know, he's got it. He's got to keep moving forward in some way and he's going to have to figure this out. It's not an easy thing to figure out. I mean, like all kinds of great. You don't know the passwords to half the things, right? Like all kinds of stuff that you don't even really think about because knock on wood, this never happens. But you know, just seeing how somebody overcomes adversity and deals with really tough situations is another thing where you sort of see, you know, characters revealed in moments of difficulty and adversity. You see how somebody handles something. You think, you know what? I think they're going to figure things out. Fast forward to yesterday. I think",yes
"0:31:58 Shaan: something like that. Yeah. He's pretty baby face. I don't know. He seems youngish. I'll tell you two other interesting things. So yesterday, the reason why we're talking about is yesterday, they announced we should probably should have led with this. Yesterday, they announced they raised a series a 12 and a half million dollars series a from light speed",no
"0:32:17 Shaan: Yeah, I think a little more than that. So they, they raised this money and they, he posted a graph of their ARR. So their annual recurring revenue and it's a hockey stick curve. It's 3 million in ARR. And like, I don't know how long, let me, let me check. I think it's sort of like, yeah, through three million AR and like 12 to 18, like 18 months, maybe something like that. Just really, really, really impressive. And so the run rates, I think 4 million, he's like, and he said in the thing, we're trying to end the year at 12 million. Super impressive.",no
"0:32:49 Shaan: 12. That's what he's trying to jump. He says currently at a four million dollar run rate. They have three million of recurring revenue from their subscription product plus another million of revenue from their like, because they'll help you. Let's say you want to sell ads or you want to monetize your newsletter. They'll help you monetize your newsletter too. So they have like other products now. Wow. And it says, yeah, I forgot. He goes to the chart, but I think it's like roughly 18 months to two, you know, maybe 24 months at the max that it did that. Oh, you got a call",no
"0:33:19 Shaan: Hell yeah, That's right. I'm in the ballpark, baby. So I think that this is an interesting example. I'm curious to see how this plays out. I could see this still, honestly, going one of two ways. I'm an investor, but I could totally see this being a great business that wasn't venture scale, meaning he might sell this thing for a hundred, they might get to 25 million in revenue and sell for $200 million. I think that could be, that's probably the expected outcome, to be honest.",no
"0:33:48 Shaan: Yeah, I'd be happy for them. I mean, we would make some money. It wouldn't be like the type of return we would. Like, you know, that you would like in a startup portfolio, you're obviously looking for these like billion dollar plus outcomes, but Hey, you know, like that's a wins a win and I would be really happy for their team. So, you know, I think that would be life-changing money for him and be a great outcome. I think that's like, that's like the, the like, if they do well, if they execute well, I think that's on the table. I think what's The question is how big does this kind of newsletter media thing get? Can this get to the scale where, okay, if they're trying to get to 10 million AR this year, they're at four trying to get to 10. If they get to a hundred, right, if they 10X once from, If they 10x from there over the next five years, that's now a billion-dollar company. The question is, can it become that? What would they need to do to do that? I think that's going to be the challenge or the big question for them.",no
"0:35:31 Shaan: Yeah, I think that could be totally totally totally the case. So on convert kit, their MRR right now says basically 3 million a month. So 36, so it's 30 36 million a",no
"0:35:46 Shaan: Yeah, 3.5% a month.",no
"0:35:53 Shaan: No, I don't know. I can't math. I don't do public math. Definitely don't try to do monthly compounding and extrapolate that for 12 months. That's not easy for me, but I think three, you know, three and a half percent churn per month is, you know, obviously not great, but it's also not like bleeding and in SAS metrics.",no
"0:36:53 Shaan: Yeah, I'll give you two other little frameworks around this. So one is from Paul Graham. Paul Graham wrote this essay once where he goes, a thing I've noticed in successful entrepreneurs, Paul Graham created YC. So he saw, you know, whatever, thousand plus entrepreneurs try to come through there and picked very well. He goes, one of the things I would say is most commonly linked with like success. He goes, can you describe this person as an animal? And what that means is not, oh, he's like a giraffe. He's got a long neck. No, it means, could you just be like, dude, that guy's an animal, right? She's an animal. It's basically just describes the sort of tenacity, intensity and speed with which somebody moves and just figures things out and gets through obstacles and breaks through plateaus. And that one piece of like, kind of like investing advice has really stuck with me and like served me well, because it's really easy to get analytical about the market, about the product, about the industry, about the competitors. And you should, that's good. Look at it from all angles. But whenever I'm like, this person's an animal, I'd make a bet. For better or worse, I'm just like, I'm just going to err on the side of betting on people when I can describe them as an animal because that type of person could figure things out. And I think on balance, it's just a higher predictor of like outside success. And also the opposite is true. I've made some mistakes in investing when I'm like, oh, I love this market, love this product. And I'm sort of projecting if somebody was just a beast and took this on, they would just crush it. And I kind of overlooked the fact that the person going after is sort of soft and timid and seems to lack aggression and doesn't seem to know their shit. They don't really know their numbers that well. When I ask about the customers, they don't really know. They post",yes
"0:38:38 Shaan: Yeah, they keep wondering about stuff. And when I ask them what's going on three weeks later, they don't really have clarity on what's changed, what's better, what they're focused on. When they hit, they get overwhelmed easily. And it's like, I've also talked myself into market investments. And I guess for me, early stage investing, I think that the, is the person an animal is just a very important test. That's one.",no
"0:39:23 Shaan: A hundred percent. I'm going to shit on my own portfolio this way. I would, I said this the other day, I said to my investment partner, Romain, I go, Romain, man, like, I feel like maybe 15, best case, 20% of our portfolio writes good updates. I said, that makes me worried. Because I was like, really, there's two buckets. There's people who just don't write updates at all, or they're inconsistent. They pop up when things are good or they need something and then they disappear for nine months when things are going tough. And Paul Graham also has written about that, which is when you stop talking is when things go bad. Like the people who survive are the ones who continue being in communication even when things are tough.",yes
"0:40:03 Shaan: when it's like, hey,",no
0:40:10 Shaan: Exactly.,no
"0:40:12 Shaan: We invested in one company early on that's a pretty famous company in Silicon Valley. It was really hot for a period of time. And now it's like people have gone sour on it. And they said they like would write their first when they were, when it was really hot, they would write these very surface level updates. Like, Oh, we hired this VP and this person and this person, and we brought on this new investor. It's like, cool, but what about the business? How's business going? And you're almost like, it's almost like, don't ask about the business. So it's like, what's going on? Why is that the feeling? And then sure enough, 18 months later, oh, bad news coming out. We had to do layoffs And there's bad press article and all this stuff. And we're just, you know, we really need to raise money, but it's not looking good. It's like, what's your burn rate? We burn 3 million a month. I was like, dude, what? And why haven't you been saying this, right? Like, it's an unbelievable. And then, and if you ask them, like, okay, what's the problem right now? It's like, oh, the problem is, you know, the funding market right now and this, that's like, no, the problem was you were burning $3 million a month for a long period of time without the corresponding like, you know, reward for that burn. You know, you weren't growing in proportion to that burn and you were reckless with money. Like that's the reality. That's the honest lesson out of it. You might be telling yourself some other story. Similarly, with our portfolio, I would say about 20% are writing good updates. And a good update is, Here's the anatomy of a good update. I might actually just release a template for all on this, but it's basically, hey guys, as a reminder, we are Hampton. What we do is this, right? Like first, just like say what you do, not that like your investors forget, But in general, you're not top of mind for people and you should have a real clear punchy thing that you're drilling in this association. Whenever you think of this word, think of us. Whenever somebody has this problem, think of us. And so like, first start with that. Then say, last month was, and your answer here, a great month, good or bad? Answer that question and then write the KPIs. And the KPIs got to be revenue, active users or active usage, active customers in some way. The negative of that, so some churn or, you know, cost number associated with that, net burn, maybe cash balance, you know, how much cash do we have on hand? And then you want to write the number for, we have to write the number for what it is in parentheses. You want to write, how much is that up month over month and what is your goal?",yes
"0:42:35 Shaan: are you doing against your own goals? Because our annual goal is to get to 10 million in revenue or get to a hundred million in revenue. And to do that, we need to be doing X and we're actually either above that, below that or on track. That's the honest way to start an update. Below that, you can write whatever the hell you want to be honest. You got to write that part first. The next part you should write is why that happened. So revenues down because blank revenues up because we tried this affiliate thing and it's actually working pretty good. We're going to double down on it. Revenue is down because blah, blah, blah. The users is flat because you know, we didn't do X, Y, Z, or we are doing X, Y, Z, and it's just maintaining, we're going to figure out how to get to the next level. So you have your, your sort of two sentence commentary on the metrics. Then after that, you could put your ask like, here's what I need from you. And below that, you can put in whatever the hell updates you want. Honestly, I don't",no
"0:43:24 Shaan: What you don't want to do is what a lot of people do. Hey, we have this article. Can you share that's the, you know, the start of the update. Just a quick update on our end. Good month for us. We made these four hires. I want to welcome Steve. It's like, why are we talking about Steve? You're a VP of marketing. They just go on. Steve used to work at Visa, but now he's over here. And that's really great. Blah, blah, blah. Oh, on the product side, we released these new updates. It's like, dude, this is not where you put patch notes. I'm like, your investors care about something and you don't want to go over here and wave your hands about all this other shit that's not actually like the core relevant information. And I think it's just wild to me that people don't get that. I refuse to I'll die on that hill. That's how investor updates should be written. And it's crazy to me that people don't just do that consistently.",no
"0:44:30 Shaan: You used to send me your updates and they were phenomenal. They were perfect. It was exactly in this format. And you were like, you know, you're just the university of common sense. It's not like you were like getting mentorship or advising or your fifth startup is just like, all right, what are people going to care about? Like, obviously, the key metrics, how I think how it's going, what I think about those key metrics, and what we're going to do next. That's what your update was,",yes
"0:46:02 Shaan: It kills me. It kills me. It kills me. So you're saying honest in the sense of lying. I actually think that's the minority case. I don't think people are actively lying. I think if they're lying to anyone, they're lying to themselves. I think what actually happens",no
"0:46:13 Shaan: it is. So I think it's, There's three scenarios. Either you know the situation and you don't want to say it, bad. Or you just don't even know the situation. You're not on top of these things, really bad.",no
"0:46:30 Shaan: Or you know it, you don't want to say it, and you're intentionally withholding the information in order to mislead or misrepresent or whatever, the worst. And so it's really bad, bad, or badder, right? Like, you know, bad, bad, or bad. It's like, there's really not a good explanation. The only good explanation that I will accept is that there are some companies that are doing so phenomenally well, and they know that investors are actually kind of a leaky bucket, and They want their rumor mill to go ahead. Now, let me tell you the number of times it's that out of a hundred is one out of a hundred.",no
0:49:01 Shaan: Yeah. Shut up and push. Shut up. Yeah.,no
"0:49:14 Shaan: three just as preventative measures,",no
"0:49:36 Shaan: They're like, Oh, I love Sam. He keeps, he always keeps tabs on me. What a good guy.",no
"0:49:51 Shaan: Yeah, this is kind of fun moment. So we, a few episodes ago, we did this.",yes
"0:49:57 Shaan: Black Rifle Coffee, it's a coffee brand. So it's a coffee brand that I would describe as like, it's like kind of patriotic. It's like an American, it's like has an American vibe to it.",no
"0:50:17 Shaan: It's kind of like a, you know, just to put it in a box, which I'm sure they don't, they don't love, but like whatever, just to, for, for, for simplicity sake.",no
"0:50:27 Shaan: of the four guys or four of the five guys were former, you know, military, Marines, whatever, something like that. And so they and",yes
"0:50:35 Shaan: Oh, there you go. So they, they start this thing. And there's a kind of interesting origin story to this. It becomes a, it becomes a really popular brand. In fact, like, not only did they sell a lot of coffee, They sold enough, they sell enough product that they basically, they went, they've gone public. So let me see their stock as",yes
0:50:56 Shaan: still.,no
"0:50:56 Shaan: it's a little less now. Maybe the whole market's gone down. So current market cap is 1.1 billion. So they built a billion dollar DTC brand, basically consumer packaging.",no
0:51:29 Shaan: So I did a call with him.,yes
"0:51:32 Shaan: one Richard. And so I think he might be in Hampton too. So he, he had said something slightly different. He didn't talk about Facebook pages. He talked about YouTube. So he was like, I was like, what's your story? He's like, well, I was like, you know, he's like, wanted to be an actor. It goes to Hollywood. It's like, whatever. It's not really working out exactly. Great. He's been in a couple of things, but he teaches himself to code. He starts making iPhone apps really early on in the iPhone app store. Does pretty good with that ends up getting hired by Verizon or something like that to do like something on the marketing side for them. And along the way, he starts doing YouTube fairly early on. And so he's doing YouTube videos and for the brand, but also for himself, like personally doing YouTube videos. And he starts building a pretty big YouTube following. And then him and his buddies start trying out different products. And they're trying out, you know, this and that and no, should we do a, I don't know what the examples were, but it's like, you know, let's just pretend t-shirt brand and the shoe brand and you know, this, this thing, that thing hats. And then coffee was one of them and the coffee one took off. And that's kind of like how they, they rallied around black rifle coffee to this day. I think they do like tens of millions in merch sales, not the coffee, but just like people love the brand so much they'll buy the t-shirts and so tens of millions of merch that there's t-shirt companies fashion companies that do tens of millions and that's their whole business. This is like their their spinoff business. That's like how strong the brand is. In fact, when I'm on the zoom call with him, his background, I'll put a picture up on the YouTube channel, but it's just like a great example of like how to like this kind of like the subtle branding that exists today when you're on a zoom call, it's like your background, your clothes, like says everything about you because that's how we meet now. Right. So you can actually bring a full story in about your home and everything. And he's got like, you know, on the wall, he's got his, his camo thing. He's got his gun. He's got his, like, he's got all the stuff. That's kind of like that same vibe that, you know, like, you know, the American tough guy, military veteran, you know, like that sort of vibe. So we're talking, he's telling me the great story. And the reason why we're talking is because he's like, dude, I was listening to the pod and I heard you talk about the total man thing. He's like, something just hit me. He's like, I just love that. I love the total man thing. I went on, I saw that somebody had the domain and I bought it and I was like, Oh, cool. Like I didn't, I was like, I swear I looked at the domain. It wasn't available. He goes, Oh no, no, I bought it off somebody. Like, I think he bought it probably like 10 or 20 grand. And he's like, yeah, he's like, I just want to gift it to you. And like, if you want to do something with it, great. That'd be awesome.",yes
"0:53:59 Shaan: He's like, I hope I can write this off or something, but you know, I just wanted to do this. I was like, a baller move. It's like when Dharmesh, I think has done that for you, like on your birthday, he bought you your domain.",yes
"0:54:13 Shaan: And so baller move. And I was like, what resonated about the total man thing? He's like, I don't know, man. He's like, I just felt like the way you talked about, like the way you and Sam talked about just like, look, it's important to me that I like stand for something. My own, I live by a code. I care about fitness. I care about these things. I care about being a man. And that's important to me. And you're right that society has really pushed this thing that if you're trying to be a man, it's toxic masculinity. And it doesn't have to be. You don't have to be a jerk or, you know, like rude in any way, but like, why is it bad to like, want to be manly? And I think it just kind of like resonated with him. And so we bought this thing.",no
"0:55:02 Shaan: think there was an understandable reason that they were angry, which is we gave it. And when we were talking about it, we were like, you know, I think you're seeing the craving for this type of content and this movement embodied in people who take an extreme version of that, like Andrew Tate or stuff like that. People like people just immediately, they hate Andrew Tate so much. They get blinded by rage and they're like, you guys are saying Andrew Tate's awesome. And this total man thing is about Andrew Tate. It's like, no, no, no. I'm just saying like, when you look at objectively that this guy's extremely popular, he's the number one, most Googled man in America right now.",no
"0:55:35 Shaan: And we're saying, what is the appeal? I think part of the appeal, not the whole thing, but part of the appeal is that this guy preaches that you need to live like a fucking man. And he's like, you be hard. Don't be soft. Like mentally be hard, be tough, physically be hard, be fit. You know, in your relations with people, don't, you know, be a softie. Don't get pushed over. Don't keep apologizing and groveling. Like, you know, carry yourself like a man. And I was like, what we had said was that I think the pendulum has swung too far in one direction where a lot of people are preaching like a sort of like, I don't know what you would call it, almost like a softer, sort of like a genderless identity thing where it's not cool to be a man. And I think that's building up a craving for people to want to be a man. And so, whatever, something resonated with that. He bought the domain and I was like, yeah, we should do something. We should try to just make it an open source movement. And When I mapped it out, I did a little five minute brainstorm the other day with Ben. And I was like, yeah, what does the total man mean? I was like, this is a good little branding lesson. At first I went down the path of like, what matters to me? But like, what matters to me is like, I like to have, I care about like freedom, like financial freedom. I care about fitness. I'm trying to get more and more fit. I want to be somebody who is free to move their body in certain ways and is a very fit individual. But I also care about family and whatever. And I was like, Oh, I think I just described something generic. I said, what's the real appeal of this total man thing. It's not this well, well-rounded appeals to actually nobody. And I said, Sam said something once on the podcast that made me laugh, But I kind of like, I wanted to make fun of him. And I also kind of liked that he was like jealous and I wanted to make fun of him at the same time.",yes
"0:57:21 Shaan: You, you said this thing, it's going to sound so simple. It's going to sound dumb. You said it's important to me to be a fucking man. What are you even saying? Isn't that obvious? You said that and you go, yeah, it's just important to me, like to be a man and like to be like, you know, I don't even know how you explain it. Maybe you didn't even explain it. That would make the",no
"0:58:13 Shaan: Exactly. And I was like, I think it's more that. It's basically, I was like, I don't think it's about this well-rounded blah, blah, blah, because it dilutes the message.",no
"0:58:37 Shaan: I was like that. Don't you feel that way? And I was like, hell no, I don't feel that way. What are you talking about? It's a ridiculous thought. You took your most ridiculous thought and then said, don't you feel that way sometimes? No, I've never once in my life looked around a room of men and been like, I could eat and kill all these people or outrun them. Not once. But when you said it, it's stuck in my head. It was provocative. I wanted to make fun of you, But I was also like, you know, there is a nugget of truth in this madness and that is where a real brand is built. And so that was my little branding revelation to myself when I was doing this exercise around that what should we do with this total man domain. I was like, honestly it's real simple. It's about being a man. It's about men who want to be a man. What does that mean? We don't need to explain it. It's somebody who handles their business. You can come up with all the examples you want. It's not a checklist. That's not the total man attitude is having some, some predefined criteria checklist. No, in all situations, be a man about it. And that's what I was like, that's",yes
"0:59:44 Shaan: Be a man about it. No matter what the situation, be a man about it. And I was like, that's the total bad philosophy. You could apply that to whatever situation you're going through in life.",no
"1:00:09 Shaan: Here's here's here's the idea fresh off the dome. You just said what do you want to do with it? You asked a great question. My brain came up with an answer. It's inspired by 75 hard, which is also a very Total Man thing. And it's great. Total Men don't always join movements. Sometimes we create them. So we're gonna create our own version of this and it's gonna be the Man Month. And what is the Man Month? It's basically 30 days where you commit to working towards being the total man in these like, you know, couple of ways. And it's like, for 30 days, we're doing cold shower. We're doing 50 pushups right when we wake up or 100 pushups right when we wake up first thing. It doesn't matter. You're all you're late. All right. You're 10 minutes more late. Go right. Oh, you can't do a hundred pushups. I'm waiting. Keep going. We'll stay here until you're done.",no
"1:01:02 Shaan: pushups and cold, I think is two. We just need a third. And it's going to be, you do these three things. You're just going to do them for 30 days straight. And we're just going to harden you up. Just going to harden you up a little bit. And so what's the third? What's the third in this thing?",no
"1:01:27 Shaan: You gotta tell someone how you feel. It could be kind. It could be, oh, you've been avoiding confrontation. It's time to",no
"1:01:37 Shaan: Oh, you really appreciate somebody? You better show it, right? And so you're going to send a message, voice memo, text message to your mom, to your coworker, to whoever. And we're gonna do that every day. You gotta",no
"1:01:48 Shaan: gonna do that every day for 30 days. A tough conversation, a tough shower, but a tough morning. That's how we're doing it.",no
"1:02:00 Shaan: A total, yeah, a total one.",no
1:02:07 Shaan: My critique of my own thing there. It's a little too easy. I think it needs to be a little bit harder. Potentially.,no
"1:02:20 Shaan: And people have to look at you and be like, Are you nuts?",no
"1:02:34 Shaan: Yeah, that's got to be a lot more though. The original thing I was thinking about because I was like, what would it mean? Because a lot of this also inspired when ducted the Murph thing and I was like, oh, sucks kind of been a man right now. Like what's going on? This is, that's pretty cool. Could I do that? I don't think I could do this. I can't do a hundred pull-ups like this is something I can't do. All right. All right. So I started working towards it. So the next morning I woke up And I did my little quarter Murph. I ran the, oh, he runs a mile. All right. I'm gonna run the quarter mile. I'm gonna do a quarter of the pushups, quarter of the pullups, quarter of the squats, right. And I'll do it again until that's easy. When that's easy, I'm gonna make it harder. Right. I'm just going to keep inching it forward until I could do the full thing. And I was like, yeah, that's the way to go. It's progress, right? Like it's about progress. And so I think you're right. I think we kind of need to workshop the actual difficulty level. Cause I think it to hit the brand, right? It's gotta be something that other people think you're crazy for doing.",yes
1:03:32 Shaan: It can't be reasonable.,no
"1:03:39 Shaan: By the way, no money.",no
"1:03:41 Shaan: When I charge money, this isn't a program you buy. It's just a movement. You're either in or you're out. That's it. That's it. You're in, and if you're in, you gotta do it. If you're out, stay out.",no
1:04:00 Shaan: Never. Never.,no
"1:04:04 Shaan: It feels good to be a man, yes.",no
"1:04:59 Shaan: We're not chasing trends here. This is timeless. People have been trying to be hard for their whole life, since the beginning of time. In fact, the only thing that turns me off is if this is a trend.",no
1:05:13 Shaan: Do you,no
1:05:15 Shaan: I'm going to do my Elizabeth Holmes and start talking with a deeper voice on purpose.,no
1:05:26 Shaan: a dude. I think that's why Mike Tyson became Mike Tyson. I think he had to overcompensate for his voice and just turn into an absolute savage.,no
1:05:35 Shaan: It's not low.,no
"0:00:00 Shaan: So that was the other thing that sparked drama. Now you've got leaked phone calls, you've got the CEO calling a guy crazy, he said, she said. And so that raised the profile of what was otherwise kind of a small thing. As the thing on Reddit, small things could turn into big things. That's like part of the beauty of Reddit. And that's what was happening here.",no
"0:00:27 Shaan: I have a little more for you here. All right, ready? This is the part that that's the background.",no
"0:00:31 Shaan: Now let me give you some foreground, right? Let me give you a little future play here. OK,",no
0:00:37 Shaan: Let me give you a little foreplay.,no
"0:00:48 Shaan: what's up? We're here. Dude, have you seen this Reddit revolt that's happening? Are you aware of this?",no
"0:01:04 Shaan: Yep. Here's kind of the, I would say the zoomed out version of the story. So what's happening today is if you go to Reddit right now, the whole site is down. So they broke all of Reddit. What they were trying to do was just a bunch of subreddits. So these communities on Reddit were trying to protest some new Reddit policies. So it started with a few of them that said, you know what, we disagree with this policy change that's going on. Yeah, we're going to do this 48 hour blackout. We're going to go private. We're going to go dark."" They called it Reddit Go. The subreddit is going dark. More and more started joining to the point where 7, 000 subreddits including some of the biggest ones on there, like r slash funny and r slash pics and stuff like that.",no
"0:01:51 Shaan: Yeah. It's a huge amount. There's a couple of cool websites that you can go to. In fact, we should go to one of them right now. So go to this site. So it's reddark. So reddark.untoned.uk, very strange site, but you can see in real time, this thing's almost like this tool's even almost broken because so many are going dark at the same time. And Ben, if you could share your screen. So it says 7, 240 out of 7, 806, that's like 90% or something, right? 740 out of 7, 806, 93% of subreddits have gone dark, which is just an insane number. And if you do it, if you click the large thing, there's like a live feed. It'll be like, animalswithjobs has just gone private, 5, 000 members. Musichoarder has gone private, 5, 000 members. Crustywindows has gone private. And you just see like in real time. And I've been watching this since yesterday. It's crazy. When I opened this up yesterday, it was at 2, 000 and now it's basically all of them. It's 7, 200 out of 7, 800. Almost every subreddit has decided to join this protest. You say, well, what's the policy? What's so bad? What happened is Reddit wants to IPO. Reddit wants to go public in the future. Reddit is not currently profitable. They make about, I don't know, somewhere between 400, $500 million a year roughly, and they're still not profitable. These apps that other people had made, called third-party apps, were just used to, like You could browse Reddit and they built special features into them that made them maybe easier to use for certain types of people, power users or moderators, things like that. That's why people loved Apollo is because they had some power user features that were great for moderators. Reddit made the mistake of, they thought they were picking on Apollo, but in fact they were pissing off moderators. And that was a really, really big issue. And I'll tell you why in a second. So Reddit goes and says, hey, look, we can't keep giving these third-party apps full access to Reddit. This has a couple of problems. First, they're hitting our servers with a bunch of requests that costs us. He said what the CEO said was tens of millions per year in server requests. The second thing is those server requests are now serving Reddit content onto someone else's app. So that person can monetize their app and Reddit doesn't get a piece of that. So they were like, all right, we wanna cut costs, we wanna increase revenue. And they had a third problem, which was they didn't want their data going to all these different places because basically OpenAI and ChatGPT had the scraped Reddit. Reddit was like one of the key sources to make chat GPT so good. And Reddit kind of was asleep when they did the first scrape. But now they're like, oh, no, no, no, no. If any other AI company wants our data, you're going to pay us a huge amount of money for it. So to do that, they needed to basically paywall the data. They needed the data only to live inside their own walls. So they upped their API pricing. They basically said, for every server request you do, it's now going to be whatever, 10 cents and a fake number. But the result was that an app like Apollo, which is made by basically this one dude who made it, you know, as a passion project out of college, he would have to pay 20 something million dollars a year just to maintain Apollo. And so he's like, dude, that's unfeasible. I, he's like, I have a 50, 000 paying users. They pay me 10 bucks a year. So he's like, I make 500K on this. Now my costs are gonna, in 30 days, my costs are gonna go to 2 million a month. And he's like, that obviously kills my app. And it kills not just my app, all the third-party apps. And Reddit's answer was basically like, shrug? Like, you know, all right, well, sucks to be you. And then the way that they kind of responded...",no
0:05:54 Shaan: no one knows as they use it.,no
"0:06:52 Shaan: the way, the result of that was the CEO got fired. They got two, back then, they got 200, 000 people to sign a petition saying, Ellen Powell needs to get fired. And so she stepped down, like, I don't know, a week later or days later after that happened. So they, you know, they do wield a lot of power.",yes
0:07:16 Shaan: 30,no
"0:08:01 Shaan: Well, again, the people that use his app were power users. When he said, hey guys, here's what's going on and it actually happened in multiple steps. The reason this got so much heat is because it happened in multiple stages. He said, they announced that they were going to update their pricing. He's like, hey, we're gonna have to keep an eye out for this but I'm optimistic. Like I'm sure Reddit's not gonna, they're not gonna like just do something that doesn't make any sense. And Reddit's like, for sure, for sure. We're obviously gonna take everybody's needs into account but we will have to update the pricing. And he's like, you know what? That's reasonable. I can't wait to hear back what you guys have in mind. That was like post one. And he shared that,",no
"0:08:39 Shaan: He shared it on subreddit, on Reddit, and maybe in the Apollo subreddit plus some others. And so like the mods subreddit, because again, a lot of moderators like Apollo because it helps them do their job faster. Because these guys-",no
"0:08:52 Shaan: No, they make nothing. So Reddit has this huge fleet, like of the moderators that are in the dark one, I think right now, there's 28 million moderators, I think that was the number, that are participating in this. Some insane number, let me see.",no
"0:09:15 Shaan: Sorry, I got the number wrong. 28, 000 moderators on the 7, 000 subreddits that are participating in the blackout basically. So these moderators, basically they're constantly fighting spam. So when you have a site that's as popular as Reddit, there's a huge amount of people that are trying to get you to buy their crap, that are trying to get you to subscribe to their OnlyFans, that are trying to get you to click this link and install this virus, and, or just doing click bait, like just making it where they post something super outrageous just to get clicks and engagement, upvotes and a big battle in the comments. But then it kind of turns off people who were there for like, you know, they wanted the entertainment without it getting ruined, without the party getting ruined. And so the moderators were the people that were keeping this house party working, where it's like, yeah, we want people to come here and have fun, but no, dude, you can't bring 17 kegs in here. No, you can't just come here and flyer your own party inside my house. Like, no, no, you can't do all that crap. And they're fighting this constantly and they do it as a giant unpaid thing. Now, what they pointed out during this protest very reasonably was that, dude, Reddit's one of the only networks that's all run by unpaid volunteer moderators. So for example, Facebook has a huge moderation program. They spend about 200 or $300 million a year just on content moderation. Twitter spends a bunch of money in content moderation. And so content moderation can be a very big cost center. And so the moderators are like, hey, you're trying to save $10 million by shutting off these third-party apps? Have you thought about what happens when we stopped doing all this free work and like now you have to pay for content moderation or this whole site goes to shit. Like what's gonna happen then? Maybe you should listen to us. And so that's where this has escalated to. But just to finish the story. So he goes, he says upfront, okay, Reddit announces change, it's gonna affect us, but hopefully it's all good. And some people in the comments were like, dude, you're being naive. These corporations are like, just like Twitter killed all the third-party clients, Reddit's gonna do the same. These guys wanna go public. They're gonna wanna own all, they're gonna wanna own the user experience for all users of Reddit, they're gonna kill you. And he's like, no, no, no, no, no, they said, they said they're gonna be fair. Okay, a couple months later it comes out and they're like, here's the pricing, it kills you, and it takes into effect in 30 days. He's like, what? First of all, ridiculous pricing. Second of all, 30 days, I couldn't possibly try to change my app to maybe make less requests to your server. I couldn't do anything in 30 days. You're just going to kill my whole business. I took yearly subscription. I'm not only in my app going to die, I'm going to have to refund like $250K to people who paid for a year subscription because my app is no longer going to work. So he was in a world of trouble. So he contacts Reddit and he does a call with the team from Reddit. And he records the call. And after the call,",no
"0:12:08 Shaan: Dude, in Neckbeard Nation, it's all good, baby. It's all legal. You're the little guy fighting the big guy. You can do whatever you want. And so, at first, he doesn't do anything with it. Then Reddit comes out and says, this guy's crazy. He's making outlandish claims. He tried to extort us for, he asked for $10 million in order to like keep supporting the app. We can't do business with this crazy guy. And they basically like kind of like just, you know, slandered him a little bit. And he's like, what are you talking about? That's not what I said. And what did I say that was so outrageous? And he's like, here's the recording. People can listen to it themselves and decide.",yes
"0:12:46 Shaan: I haven't listened to the whole thing, but there's a part in there where he's like, look, like. Did he sound reasonable? Yeah, he sounds reasonable. And he's basically like, look, you know, obviously I'd love to just keep going independent, but you guys are saying it's too expensive if you want to raise pricing. That makes it untenable for me. But people like this app and they're going to be upset when this app goes down. He's like, you know, you guys bought Alien Blue back in the day and you made that the Reddit app. Like, have you considered just buying this app so that you can, like, you don't have to pay for all these extra, you know, it's not some external party that you guys can own it, but at least it lives on and it's a win-win solution potentially for all of us.",no
"0:13:22 Shaan: And so he was like, he said something like, you're saying this will cost me 20 million a year, you're saying this costs you tens of millions a year, you could buy the whole thing for $10 million and that's six months of my operating costs and it could work out that way. And Steve Huffman on the call is like, look, I don't appreciate the threat type of thing. He says something about that's a threat. And he goes, wait, what's a threat? What do you mean? Because the guy said something like, he goes, you know, if you don't want all this noise about this, you could just do this. And he kind of took it as a threat, like, oh, you're threatening, you're gonna make a bunch of noise if we don't pay you $10 million? He goes, no, no, no, I'm saying, you're saying I'm making too many API calls. So if you don't want all this server noise for the API requests, you could just own it and just use your internal systems to do it instead. And he's like, oh, sorry, like, okay, My bad. I didn't realize you're talking about API requests. I apologize. I didn't mean to say that you were threatening us. He was like, okay, no problem. I just want to be clear on that. Then later he comes out and says he threatened us. He's like, dude, even on the call, you apologize saying, sorry, I misunderstood you. Then you took that out of context and tried to make me sound like a guy who's trying to profit out of this, or like trying to make unreasonable requests. So anyways, that caused, so that was the other thing that sparked drama. Now you've got leaked phone calls, you've got the CEO calling a guy crazy, He said, she said. And so that raised the profile of what was otherwise kind of a small thing as the thing on Reddit. Small things could turn into big things. That's like part of the beauty of Reddit. And that's what was happening here.",no
0:15:07 Shaan: I have a little more for you here. Are you ready? This is the part. That's the background.,no
"0:15:12 Shaan: Now let me give you some foreground, right? Let me give you a little future play here.",no
"0:15:18 Shaan: you a little foreplay. So Reddit, I may have forgot, but this is how Reddit started. So Reddit started because the popular forum site of the day, Dig, made this big update and everybody hated it. And Dig said, screw you guys, this is better. And they said, see ya. And they went to this little site called Reddit and Reddit blew up. And that's how Reddit became what it is, is that the Digg fumbled the ball, released this anti-user update and the users took their ball.",yes
"0:15:49 Shaan: They stuck it to the man. Well, who's to say that doesn't happen again? So I have a little proposal. Somebody should run with this idea. I bought this domain And I think somebody should do this. If not, you know, this is what I would do if I was a little younger and hungrier than I am today. So here's what I think somebody should do. I think now is the perfect time.",no
0:16:14 Shaan: My T levels were a little higher back then. Yeah. I'm a mellowed out dad now. My daughter paints my toenails. I can't be doing all this kind of stuff.,yes
"0:16:30 Shaan: Okay, so I want you to just check out this little website here. So Sam, I don't know if you know what the CEO Steve's handle is on Reddit. Do you know what his username is?",no
"0:16:45 Shaan: What was it? SPEZ. SPEZ. And so, I don't know, I just woke up this morning, 6 a.m. And I just looked at GoDaddy and I just saw that spesless.com was available. I thought, huh, one cent for spesless.com. So I bought it and I said, what's Spesless? I think it's Reddit without spes. Would you like Reddit without Steve? Well, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna make a Reddit as very, very, very, very, very similar looking to this website, but with one difference. There's no Steve, there's no corporation that's gonna-",yes
"0:17:21 Shaan: Same, same, but different, exactly right. Same, same, but different. Exactly, so here's, Ben threw this up while we were talking because I gave him a rant this morning. I was like, dude, here's what someone should do. And I think he just bought, He told me right before we went on air, he goes, I'm gonna buy the domain, I'm gonna put it up. So he goes, it says, I love Reddit. I just don't like, don't like Spaz. So I'm gonna create a new Reddit, it's called Spazless. It's Reddit without Steve. Here's the master plan. It'll be very, very, very similar website to Reddit. It's gonna be a nonprofit and any revenue that it makes will get funneled back into the communities or moderators because this blackout, like this 48-hour protest that they said, it's cool. It's going to get headlines, but Reddit really doesn't care. They're going to lose about $3 million by being down for two days. And then they're just going to move on with life. And the protesters made a big error, which is they said how long they would protest for. They said the pain will stop at 48 hours. So all Reddit has to do is just ignore it for 48 hours. They're going to keep doing what they want. So when your voice doesn't work, you gotta exit. And here's a little exit boat for you. It's basically Reddit without the bullshit. And there's a little email signup box. So if a million people sign up, then who knows? Maybe we can create something here. And so, you know, why do this as a nonprofit? Your boy's already rich. We don't need to make a profit on this. We just create this for fun because it's fun to see something burned down. I don't even have a problem with Steve Huffman, by the way. I think he's,",no
"0:18:45 Shaan: I like Steve. I think he's fair in his opinion, but also this is the internet. And in the internet, you really got to know who you're pissing off. And I think he's pissed off too many people with this move. I can't believe that nobody's making the alternative to this. The People that are trying to make alternatives, they're all trying to do it so different. You don't want to do different. It needs to look almost exactly the same. Change the shade of red by like two hex, you know, like little hex color over to the right. And then it needs to be the same site with the same structure. Everything's the same, except for who decides what happens, so how the money flows. And if you just change that, you could do this as a nonprofit thing and I think it would be very entertaining.",no
"0:19:34 Shaan: That was nice, right?",no
0:19:36 Shaan: That's our fan base.,no
"0:19:44 Shaan: Hilarious thing you did. So, listen to this. This woman... This woman sent me this beautiful... No, no, say the whole thing. What does she do? So you get something in the mail?",yes
"0:20:01 Shaan: Well, is it beautiful? It looks like a giant PowerPoint deck that we just printed out because she knows, like, oh, he might not click the link. So let me just print the PowerPoint out on white and black paper and just put it in an envelope for him.",no
0:21:02 Shaan: I thought that you said it first,yes
"0:21:14 Shaan: And the funniest thing is you go, all right, thought, let's do this. Yes.",no
"0:21:26 Shaan: She goes, LMAO, I'm being addressed as my first Thot in your email, Urban Dictionary below for your amusement.",no
0:21:48 Shaan: let's do this.,no
"0:21:54 Shaan: This is why we only have four female listeners, is because of this type of behavior.",no
"0:22:05 Shaan: Yeah, it's like when you hear someone call their friend, they're like, oh, Nikki. And you're like, what's up, Nikki? And they're like, it's Nicholas. And you're like, oh, okay, just cause he, Nicholas, got it.",yes
"0:22:46 Shaan: I love it. You're doing it wrong. It's not total man with like a space in between. Cause then it's like, yo, I'm the total man. It's I'm a total man. It's like one word. It's like, it's a, it's a thing. You're a noun. It's a different type of noun. You got, you know, mammals, you got humans, and you got Total Man. It's just like a separate species. Yeah, get",no
0:23:22 Shaan: That's it. We did it. We got a new thing. Totally agree.,no
"0:23:56 Shaan: Yeah, I get where they're coming from. I think they, like many tech companies, fumbled the communication and execution. But I'm also horrid at that. So, you know, I would have done this twice as bad if I was in their position. Because I'm always like, I'm a very much rip the bandaid off type of person. And also like, Because I'm very far on the spectrum of not easily offended, it takes a lot to make me feel like mad or upset. I severely underestimate how easily I can make other people mad or upset. I get their position. I think most likely, unless Bezalus becomes a thing, they're just gonna be like, cool, nice protest. We hear you, we'll take you into account in the future. Continue using Reddit. Life will just go on and nothing bad will happen from this unless literally somebody seizes the narrative. That's the thing. There's a narrative right now and somebody could come in and they could surf that momentum on the narrative.",no
0:24:57 Shaan: though. We are the thing.,no
"0:25:06 Shaan: Like this happened in the crypto world. Crypto world is like the most like ruthless. It's like, just like knife fighting in the streets. And so OpenSea had some policy issue or some change. I don't, Do you remember what it was? It was like the fee change or something. Why did people get mad at OpenSea when they... I forget what it was, they changed something. They changed the royalty's effect. Yeah, they changed like the royalty take rate or something.",yes
"0:25:33 Shaan: Have you seen Joe Rogan? If Joe Rogan does it, anyone can do it. So basically OpenSea, which was the big NFT marketplace, by far the dominant and 100% market share type of thing, changed something in the policy. People didn't like it. And literally like in like a 48 hour period, somebody spun up a competitor and they did what was called a vampire attack, which was they, in crypto you could do this thing where you could be like, okay, who are all the wallets that use OpenSea? I could find them, they're all public, that I can airdrop them tokens that say, if you come over to our platform and claim them, create your account here, you get free tokens. And people are like, token, might be worth something. And so they just like, they basically like VampireTech, they just suck the blood out of one network to another. And this has happened several times in crypto where they've basically tried to do this. Now it's not always 100% successful, but to go from, you didn't even exist to like a million to 2 million users with like a shot at, hey, if you deliver a dope user experience, this can work, that's like better than nothing. And so In crypto, this has happened a couple of times. A couple of the DeFi tools have had this happen, where we don't like your policy, we're going to fork your source code, rename it, and we're going to incentivize all the major players on yours to come over here and get like a bonus token if they come claim their thing here, which builds the momentum and the narrative.",no
"0:27:18 Shaan: The Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, that's so on fire. How do you even remember or",yes
0:27:29 Shaan: Have you been to a monster truck rally in the last 700 days.,no
"0:27:35 Shaan: Yeah, I've grown a monster truck all the time.",yes
"0:27:43 Shaan: All right, let me talk",no
0:27:50 Shaan: a lot of stuff.,no
0:28:03 Shaan: I think time.,no
"0:28:37 Shaan: Yeah, I've seen this. So Eric Tornberg's behind this. Eric's an awesome guy. Did he talk to you about this before he did it? Cause I feel like if I was gonna do something like this, you're my phone-a-friend, right?",yes
"0:28:49 Shaan: to me. You're my phone-a-friend on that. I've never talked to him. Oh, you never talked to him, so you don't know each other that well. Okay, gotcha. No. Because he's in our friend group, I guess. Okay, so I'm curious what your take is on this, because I think",no
"0:29:03 Shaan: I want you to explain it. I mean, I think you said it well. He's trying to create like what I would say the easiest analog is like the ringer. So the ringer was started by Bill Simmons. So kind of like famous notable guy in the in the sports journalism landscape basically was like, I'm going to create a network of sports podcasts. I'll have my show. I'll have this guy do NBA. I'll have this guy do NFL. I'll have this guy do, you know, pop culture. I'll have this guy do whatever. And so they created a network of podcasts, ended up selling it to Spotify for a few hundred million dollars, 200 something million dollars. And Really that was mostly because Bill had the number one sports podcast and he's very influential and Spotify had a strategy there. Eric's trying to do that for tech. He's like, how do I be the ringer? How do I be barstool, but for the tech industry? Can I basically create intellectual, entertaining but also highly intellectual conversations about things that people care about in tech? Then he's looking for shows. Basically, if we were not the badasses that we were, we could be like, hey, let's join Turpentine, we're going to get their back office, we're going to get them helping us sell ads, we're going to get help with production, and we'll get cross-promoted amongst their network. It's very similar to Workweek, which we've talked about on here before. Workweek is doing this with newsletters. Turpentine is trying to do this with podcasts plus newsletters, plus other things. His tagline is, where experts talk. It's a network podcast covering tech, business culture, and trends that are driving the future. And he's got, I think, three or four shows right now. It looks like maybe five. Three that he's doing, and then a couple that other people are doing. But they're all very fancy-schmancy, like the cognitive revolution, media empires, moment of Zen. And so they're kind of like, I would say, highbrow compared to what most podcasts are.",no
"0:31:12 Shaan: it looks awesome. Wow, I thought you were gonna be anti. You're pretty anti most media things. No, oh no,",no
0:31:19 Shaan: Oh you're doing you're doing that sandwich thing? Yeah.,no
0:31:24 Shaan: with the bread. Yeah.,no
"0:31:32 Shaan: logo, hate everything else.",no
"0:32:32 Shaan: Yeah. It says, when art critics get together, they talk about form and structure and meaning. When artists get together, they talk about where you can buy cheap turpentine.",no
"0:32:45 Shaan: Yeah, dude, so on my next company, I'm gonna get a quote from Benny Blanco. What's he going",no
"0:32:52 Shaan: I don't know, just he got Pablo Picasso, I'm going to get Benny Blanco on the side.",no
"0:33:16 Shaan: Yes. Well, a lot of like isn't Hollywood also on strike right now?",no
0:34:21 Shaan: But is this B2B? I don't think this is B2B.,no
0:34:24 Shaan: say this is B2B?,no
"0:34:26 Shaan: I think he just has, I think he has probably, he's probably going for like high-end customers more so than B2B, right?",no
0:34:48 Shaan: B2B-ish. B2B-ish.,no
0:35:18 Shaan: friends with the Jews.,no
0:35:24 Shaan: LAZARTE LAMBERT-CHAPMAN All time. All time excuse. GIGI GAL,no
"0:36:02 Shaan: You mean on his Hampton application, where he had to write his revenue, profits, names of all his children, and social security number?",yes
"0:36:14 Shaan: just clicked SimilarWeb on their site, no info. So I know you ain't getting shit from SimilarWeb right now.",no
"0:36:27 Shaan: it say? They have like their brands like Senior housing news, hospice news, skilled nursing news, that sort of thing.",no
0:36:39 Shaan: or media for the senior care industry?,no
0:37:18 Shaan: This is yeah.,no
0:37:23 Shaan: You just did this guy such a disservice by siccing four to 40 copycats on him. If I'm talking about how good of a business this is on here.,no
"0:37:34 Shaan: People who listen to this podcast are like, if Sam or Sean say the N-word, I don't mean the N-word, I mean newsletters. If they say that this is a good newsletter business, the instant copycats, bro, they saw what you did with the hustle, they saw what I did with the milk crowd, They're instantly looking for a new newsletter to clone.",yes
0:37:50 Shaan: I apologize on behalf of whoever this guy is.,no
0:38:01 Shaan: He didn't know what he was saying yes to.,no
"0:38:21 Shaan: I think it's cool. I hope he pulls it off. I've thought about doing this idea actually in the past. I ruled it out for a bunch of reasons, but- It's boring. It doesn't mean somebody else can't do it. I think it'd be great to do. It takes a lot of energy and I'm totally with you that I hope he didn't raise money. In his tweet thing announcing it, he didn't say like, so happy to have Marc Andreessen investing in this. So I think there's probably a good chance he raised money, but he didn't raise, okay,",no
0:38:45 Shaan: raise money. So I hope he is taking it that way.,no
"0:39:13 Shaan: Speaking of screwing up your money, Can I tell you what I did post Milk Road with the money that we made?",yes
0:39:41 Shaan: tell you about my next best decision?,yes
"0:39:49 Shaan: I've actually I would be about even from where I was with my equities on that because I kept well, I kept a portion of it, but I also the stuff I sold has not doubled. You just look at HubSpot stock because you're like, I got HubSpot. You're like, HubSpot is the market. HubSpot is not the market exactly. I'll tell you that. Let me tell you about what I did. We got this money, so we sell Milk Road. Now there's cash hitting a bank account. Got a couple options. So it's like, do we just buy treasury bills, make 4% on that?",yes
0:40:24 Shaan: What bank did I use? What do you mean?,no
0:40:29 Shaan: There's no upside in answering this question.,no
"0:40:34 Shaan: No, I didn't use Silicon Valley Bank. No. Money sitting there as I could buy Treasury bills. Now, that's too boring. Could do what Sam does. I could just index into the stock market, it's reasonable, but I think it seems like we're coming off of a 13 year bull market. Don't really need to put the full amount in right now. Let me just wait and see what happens there. Is there something that can do better than the eight percent that I might be able to get on that? I thought, well, should I invest in a new company? We start, I don't know, maybe if we have a great idea, we'll do that, but let me not do that. I started doing this process where I was like, I worked backwards for basically like, can I get 30% a year compounding? And 30% a year sounds like a high number, but we have a few friends who have done it. And the way that they've done it has been through buying private companies. So they buy businesses and they own them. Andrew Wilkinson, I think is the one that most people who listen to this pod will know because he's been on a bunch of times and talked about this, how they built Tiny from a few million dollars into $500 million by doing this 30, 40 percent compounding over time. Did we",no
"0:41:48 Shaan: Yeah, I read this annual letter. Yeah. We have a few other friends that have been doing this as well that are less public about it. I said, okay, well, let me do that. I said, but I don't want to buy these companies and operate them. I thought, what if I bought 30 percent stakes? It's like, can I buy a minority position in companies, so that they keep running them, but I give them capital? Basically, the founder oftentimes was not taking a lot off the table, or they were always worried like, should I put this in my pocket, and spend this? Well, I don't know, what if the company needs it? Even if we're profitable, they were worried about that. I say, here, let me give some money, and then could I help them grow? I went through this exercise. I don't think I've told you about any of these. But I talked to about 25 companies in the last, I want to say, six months.",yes
"0:42:49 Shaan: Yeah, you're like the wingman who refuses to wing.",no
"0:42:56 Shaan: My funnel was this, I was just doing a review of this, I thought it was kind of interesting. So talk to about 24 companies, I think. Got serious, like did diligence. I would say talk to means like, talk to means like I was interested. Obviously we looked at a little bit more than that, but talk to was like, oh, this could be interesting. Well, you could kind of squint and see a possibility. Then got into kind of like more serious talks that either negotiated numbers or diligence with about nine, got to a LOI stage with three or four and ended up doing one deal. And the last, I wanna say six months post sale. And so this range from everything from, so newsletter businesses, OnlyFans businesses, journal apps, virtual events, bookkeeping companies, merchant companies, and then a bunch of random stuff that I know nothing about that we're like, oh, that sounds interesting. Like some company that does something called laser peening on machines to make the parts last longer, and their clients are like Boeing and stuff like that. Or autism clinics that seem to make a ton of money, but I'm like, okay, I don't really know how I would add any value to this. In each one, I was like, all right, can I find a good operator where I can acquire minority stake of the business at a good deal, and I can help them grow? Ideally, they're the category winner for what they do. And so that was kind of like my process. I want to before I tell you about the deal that we ended up doing, I want to hear any thoughts or questions on my approach here, because there's a bunch of learnings.",yes
0:44:34 Shaan: What do you mean for that long? That long means what?,no
"0:44:43 Shaan: Oh, yeah, he's been at 20 percent for like 50 years or something.",no
0:44:49 Shaan: be dope. He's putting billions and billions of dollars to work and that's very different.,no
"0:44:58 Shaan: not sure. This was a test basically to see is this fun to do? It's definitely fun on the learning side. Now that we made the first acquisition or the first I would say not acquisition, like kind of minority investment. And it's different than startups. Like we've done startup investing. Startup investing is very, very different. Startup investing is you look at a business, you're trying to figure out, is this, are these three dudes in this bedroom gonna be able to build like a multi-billion dollar company? Right, like is this husband and wife couple gonna be able to pull off this, this gargantuan exit? And like kind of right now they have usually nothing, just an idea, product, maybe a little bit of traction.",no
"0:45:35 Shaan: It's a lottery and you put in a $100, 000 and then you do that with 40 companies, and you know that 38 of the companies are going to be just a write-off or cost of doing business, and two or three of those 30 or 40 companies are going to be your winners, but hopefully they're winning at 100x or 1, 000x or more returns. It's very lottery-like and you spend very little time with them. So you're not like, they don't want you advising them. You answer questions when they call, you can proactively nudge them a little bit, but you're mostly hands-off, I would say, angel investing. Whereas if you buy 15, 20, 25, 30 percent of a business, you're a little more involved. You're a little more active. These businesses are not like all or nothing businesses. They're like, it's already a good business, it's profitable, and it's already growing. So the question is, can we accelerate the growth? The one business we bought is, I don't know, super profitable. It makes millions of dollars a year in profits. It's more than 50% margins. And we were able to buy a piece of that. And I think that that's just so different than every startup investment I had ever done. It's probably not gonna become a multi-billion dollar business. I would almost guarantee that, but it doesn't need to. It's not supposed to. It's a cash flow business. And so...",no
"0:47:13 Shaan: No, dude, that's not true. Even in a startup fund, even when you have your winners that become billion dollar companies, the overall fund, like a great fund is doing 30 percent IRR or 20 percent IRR. Look, I'm",no
0:47:26 Shaan: It's still,no
"0:47:29 Shaan: No, it's down. I reject that. I reject that premise. I would",no
"0:47:41 Shaan: But cashflow is always interesting. It's always been interesting. And Now it's more interesting than it was in the past. I really didn't have a lot of exposure to these types of business. I lived in San Francisco. You say cash flow and people think you're talking about like a leaky faucet. Nobody knows what the hell that means. Once I started doing this podcast, we got a lot more exposure to, like most of the people who listen to this podcast are entrepreneurs all around the world. So when they reach out about their business, it's like, oh, this guy in Minnesota with this marketing agency that does this per year, or this person sells parts and this person does whatever. They're rolling up bookkeeping services. So you learn about different types of businesses more through this. So I've been getting my MBA on non-Silicon Valley businesses for",yes
"0:48:56 Shaan: So the most interesting thing is what happened between the four deals that we signed LOIs on and the one that we closed. And I'll try to do this without giving away any info about the companies that we didn't do the deal with. I can talk about the one we did, but I can't talk about the one we didn't. But the things I, the reasons that, the mistakes that we were making along the way, here's trap number one that we already experienced. I can fix him. Like the classic girlfriend mistake, like, yeah, he sucks, but maybe I could fix him. It's basically like, maybe I can fix this business. And when you do this minority investing, you're not the majority, you're not gonna be able to fix anything. And so that was, you know, trap number one was getting really far down the road with a business that I thought had a ton of potential before finally realizing I'm not gonna be the one to fix it and fixing it is the wrong approach to going into a business like this. That was mistake one. Mistake two was, I can totally see this working, but working at a small scale. And so you have to remember basically like as you play the game, it's kind of like, this is how I felt about your Airbnb, which is like, you do one Airbnb, you basically can't do one Airbnb. You can only do one as a test to see if you want to do a bunch. One Airbnb is like a bunch of headache without the size of the prize being big enough. And so we had looked at one business that was like, yeah, this could be-",yes
"0:50:20 Shaan: Yeah, yeah, we all make this mistake. But I think you were at least looking at it the right way where you were like, maybe I could do a bunch of these. You talked to people that had 50 of these in their portfolio, and you have to do one to know if you want to do 50. And so We got really far down the road with this one, that if it all worked, it's like, dude, we could be making $200, 000 a year off this. It's like, wait, what are we doing? Why are we doing this? Yeah, it's a great deal and it's highly likely to work, but it's highly likely it's going to be very small and not worth the mindshare of even doing this. So we pulled out on that one. The one that we did was basically, people probably know. So this one was not company first.",yes
"0:50:56 Shaan: Yeah, I can name it now. It's official. So we first looked at the category. So I was super bullish on companies that let you hire internationally. So specifically like how to hire the field of lizipines in Latin. And you know this.",yes
"0:51:09 Shaan: Like kind of scar tissue. Like, dude, you came to my office. I remember you came to my office in San Francisco when I was doing Bebo and you were like, what's your burn rate? Which again is like a question nobody asks somebody else out loud. It's like, you know, that's like asking somebody that's asking a woman their weight, like ask a founder their burn rate and see how they feel.",yes
"0:51:28 Shaan: And I was like 3 million a year. And that's what we were, we were Basically a startup that was burning 3 million a year pre product market fit because that's what it caused. We had we basically had a team of engineers. So we had like, you know, I don't know, 10",yes
0:51:40 Shaan: 10,no
"0:51:43 Shaan: think we were doing like 240, 000 a month in burn.",yes
"0:51:51 Shaan: We had revenue from one of our projects, but like, no, I was just saying like the overall bill. So. So we basically you hire 10 people that are 200, 000 each, you're doing two million plus you pay rent, plus you have your Cloud bill, especially whatever else. That was really expensive and those were all Silicon Valley engineers and they were below market. Those people, if they're working for us for 200K, they could have been making 400 or 500K at Facebook, but they wanted to be a part of a startup. So I did that and it was very stressful to have a very high burn rate for a company. I just didn't like it, but I didn't know any better at the time. And then afterwards, as I get a little more savvy, like with our ecom biz, we'll do probably somewhere a little under 20 million this year in revenue. We're profitable because 65% of our team is overseas. So we have our data analysis person, Argentina, our designer, India, our customer service, Philippines are the person who's running our whole wholesale channel, like built it from scratch, it did not exist. And now it's like a new revenue unit in the Philippines. And we did the same thing with Milk Road. We were profitable with Milk Road from day one. Like I remember coming to your office at the hustle and you had like, I don't know, 15 people running around there in San Francisco and that's a bunch of San Francisco issues. They have to go home and pay $6, 000 rent, so you got to pay them money. For us, we had one person in the US for Milk Road and we had everybody else in the Philippines. It was again, lean, mean, profitable machine. And I was like, oh, not just is this cost savings. If you hire someone in the Philippines, they're basically 10 times cheaper than the US. So you can hire somebody in the Philippines for $1, 000 a month, so 12, 000 in a year. That same person in the US will cost you 80 to 120K. These are skilled people like in Latin, I'm like the guy we have doing our data stuff. He's got his MBA. These are highly educated, he's like a wizard with Power BI and Looker, and all these data tools that I couldn't even start to use. Do you",yes
"0:53:49 Shaan: Yeah, of course. I'm talking to them all the time. The one good thing is, especially with the Philippines, this sounds terrible, but I'm going to say it anyways, because it's honest, I hate managing people, and I love hiring people in the Philippines because they need so little management. Like I- Why",no
"0:54:07 Shaan: Because I think what people want is for you to be like, I'm a good manager and I talk to my people and I'm like, dude, it's fucking great. I only talk, like, for example, my assistant, I only talked to her on Fridays. People are like, well, that's kind of mean, or like, it's great. They don't want one-on-ones in like career trajectory coaching. And they don't want like, like the same, like in San Francisco, I had, let's say I have eight direct reports. That's eight weekly one-on-ones I had to do. That's essentially eight hours out of the 160 hours a week that, you know, that I have that I'm like, you know, I'm spending doing basically like touchy feely stuff, which is fine. I understand it, but it's really nice when you don't have to do that because it's not the baseline expectation.",yes
"0:55:07 Shaan: people for our hold co basically. They're cool, they live in San Francisco, they're awesome, they're super motivated to work with me. I'm like, great, what do you want? Like, I want to be you. And I'm like, wait, what? And then I'm like, cool. Like, you know, someday they're like, yeah, but I'm also spinning up my own newsletter, my own podcast, my own investment arm. Like I'm like, okay, well, like that's great. You could do that. But that makes for kind of a shitty person to hire onto my team, because like part of being on this team is being down for our mission, not like your own mission necessarily. And I totally get it if you want to go do your own mission, but you got to go do that on your own. You don't get to have both, you know, at the same exact time. You could do one and get mentored for a bit and then go do your own, but you can't do them at the exact same time. It has been very nice to have people that are just like, literally like our management style is they log in, they say, log in in, here's what I'm doing today. If you have any adjustments, either you say something, if not, you just don't say anything. At the end, they say, log off, here's what I got done today. Here's everything I did, here's the files, here's the info, log it off.",no
"0:56:11 Shaan: I mean, dude, I have like, in my own companies, probably almost 15 to 20 people that are international now.",yes
"0:56:22 Shaan: It ranges, so like On the low end, 800, I think about it monthly because that's like when I push payroll, that's what it says. Eight hundred a month would be the low end, and that's I got to say most common. So that's a customer support, personal assistant, things like that can be that low. Then the higher roles will be like 2, 500 to 3, 000. Then there's one guy who's just amazing and I've promoted him up twice now. Now he gets paid like a US employee because he makes the impact of somebody who's like driving a ton of growth. So I'm like, oh, great. Like you keep getting rewarded. At some point you break breakthrough where you're if you're driving growth, you get rewarded for driving growth.",no
"0:57:01 Shaan: I have a course on the personal assistant side. Yeah, I just created it. It's not even a course actually. It's just I don't like I don't go and teach it. It's just a system. It's like, yo, basically the best hire I made this year was I hired my personal assistant and I had thought, okay, personal assistant is, you know, personal assistance like for rich people for like mega it's like for Jeff Bezos. It's like mega busy, mega rich. I also was like, I don't want to have to tell somebody what to do all the time. Like that sounds like its own pain in the ass to come up with shit to do. Then I heard a few friends talk about theirs and I was like, maybe I'm wrong. Let me open my mind to the possibility that I'm wrong about this. Three people tell me, three people that I trust tell me that it's like been a huge game changer for them. Let me try it.",yes
"0:57:42 Shaan: I, I mean, I want to use that. Yeah, I basically created the whole thing last week and I was like, here's my system. So for example, here's my email system. I used to be terrible with email, and now my email system is super organized on top of shit. Here's exactly what I do. Here's the exact scope of work. Here's how it works.",yes
"0:58:01 Shaan: Yeah. By the way, there's a funny offer we did with it, but I'll explain the company that we ended up investing in. So I looked at all the ways you could do this. I'd done all of them. So you can hire direct. If you want to hire somebody in Ashley, you can basically have three options. You hire direct. So you hire somebody on like a job board, Upwork, online job, something like that. Upside, it's basically free. You just pay the software subscription like $99 a month. So you pay $1, 000 for the year to be a pro member on there. Downside, you have to do all the hiring, vetting, training, sifting through candidates yourself. You put up, hey, I need a customer support person or a personal assistant, you're going to get 200 applications and good luck trying to find somebody good. You could also go on the high end and use a managed service. This is things like Growth Assistant or Athena. They're great. They do the vetting for you, but there's this huge upcharge. So those guys charge you three grand a month for somebody that actually costs $800 a month. So you're paying 3x the price or more every single month forever.",yes
"0:59:05 Shaan: They're big. They're big because this is like a huge ARR thing for them, and people don't really know about it. People don't really realize you didn't have to pay triple the price every single month. That's one path. But they're good at what they do. I've tried them. I've tried a bunch of these. The one I liked the best was the one we ended up investing in, which is Shepherd. So people have probably heard of Shepherd before. I think the URL is supportshepherd.com. Why I liked Shepherd was it's kind of best of both. So they do the filtering, screening, background checks, all that stuff. So basically you just say, I want a personal assistant. They present you three great candidates. So they present you five great candidates for you and they're filtered, they're checked. And they're basically like, these are the best of the best. So they save you a shit ton of time, which is like, as any business owner, you need that. On the other side, you don't have to pay the monthly upcharge. So they'll say, great, you can make the hire directly and all you pay is the one-time finder's fee for us having found you the candidate. And so it ends up being 10 to 20 times cheaper than these other ones in the long run because you just paid the one-time finders fee. I like that model the best. I was like, long-term, I think this is the most sustainable. Because if I'm making in my business, like I did, 15 hires internationally, I don't want to be paying like this bloated cost every month from there on out. Nor do I want to do that, all that work myself. So that was the business we ended up investing in. Super excited",yes
1:00:45 Shaan: It looks cool.,no
1:00:49 Shaan: He's got showmanship.,no
"1:01:03 Shaan: He owns like a boutique hotel. He did this like e-commerce thing that was like super simple and actually like a really good, like, you know, a successful business, successful e-comm business that was just like, it was like a phone case. And Like, you know, it was just that. And like when COVID came out, they came out with this little like hook thing, like your Captain Hook. I was like, you can use this to open doors without having to touch the knob like a peasant.",no
"1:01:25 Shaan: this guy's great. He just makes these like simple little businesses. And he runs all, the reason he did this is He ran his businesses using international hiring as his workforce. So then he partnered with this guy in the Philippines, opened up an office on the ground there with a bunch of recruiters to do all the vetting locally on the ground.",yes
"1:01:42 Shaan: His business partner lives there and has the office open there. So you got to commit if you're going to do these types of things. And so he basically partnered with the guy who's doing that, and that's how they created Shepherd. And it started off just like solving their own itch, but turns out like a lot of people have this itch, and myself included.",no
"1:02:30 Shaan: Yeah, basically they don't spend any money on marketing at all. So the way that it spreads is just word of mouth, people coming back, and then the other one is like entrepreneurs who have an audience saying the word. So they first did this with Nick Huber. And Nick has drove them a ton of business because Nick uses it for all of his businesses. And so when he talks about it, they get a bunch of traffic. So I think he saw the success of that. And basically, we have a large audience now, like through Twitter, through this pod, through other things. And so there's obviously a benefit of, I don't know, like the brand association, like as well as like, you know, the ability to reach, you know, reach a large audience that I think was appealing to him. But I bought in, I didn't get free shares, right? Like I bought, I bought into the equity pool, but I agree with you. When you have a really good business, you're always hesitant. It has to be the right fit. The other benefit was he listens to the pod. If you listen to this, you know how we think, and you can agree and be like, this person's great or this person's an idiot. You know if you would want to do business with them, if you listen to the pod regularly, you have a very good idea. There's no hiding our personalities on this.",no
"1:03:41 Shaan: to my website, if you go to champery.com slash remote assistant, basically here's what I got them to do, which is better than a coupon thing. So I was like, all right, if you want to do the personal assistant thing the way I did, I was like, all right, here's my systems, 250 bucks, you get the whole, like all the templates, all the thing or whatever. But I was like, I only want to make money from people who don't take action. And So here's how it works. Basically, if you just buy the course and you don't actually hire an assistant, I keep your money. But if you actually go to Shepherd and you hire your assistant, then Shepherd will give you 2X the money back. So basically you pay 250, you'll get $500 if you actually take the action and go higher. And I was like, that's kind of a no brainer offer. I was like, Marshall, we got to do this. Do this where if people want their own assistant, and they actually take their action and go forward with it, pay them back not just what they paid for the system, pay them double because I bet a bunch of people are just not going to take action, but who cares? I want the people who will take action to be rewarded for doing so. That's a pretty sweet deal. Basically, you essentially get my system for free, plus you make an extra $250 if you actually go forward with it and make your hire.",yes
"1:05:22 Shaan: Well, this one is a",no
"1:05:23 Shaan: the hard part. This is already a successful company. I'm already religious about hiring internationally anyways. Personally, in my own businesses, it's like I didn't have to be convinced that this is a good idea. Like I already knew there's a good idea. The question was, am I going to start my own of these or should I invest in one that's already working that I like, that I use? And I was like, okay, cool, let me just do the second one that seems like way less work to do that. So I think this one is kind of a no brainer in that it's kind of a proven business. I am a genuine believer in it. Whether we actually drive extra traffic to them or not, I think it's like, I don't know, obviously for them they want that, and I would like that too, but for me it was already a working business.",no
"1:06:06 Shaan: don't want to disclose that here because I think, you know, it's their business. I don't want to give that away too much, but, you know, it's a good chunk.",no
"1:06:18 Shaan: Yeah, just dividends. Like it's a profitable business. It just pays out dividends. Like I got our first dividend check yesterday. It was awesome.",yes
"1:06:27 Shaan: Yeah, it was fantastic.",no
"1:07:07 Shaan: to try it with two or three. This one I knew was a slam dunk because I'm just like, just a total believer in it. What's going to be interesting is what happens with ones that aren't like perfectly in my zone of like, I get it, I used it, I believe in it. This one was like bullseye. I don't expect every business to be exactly bullseye. So the question is, what happens when it's not exactly? Is it still fun? Do I still believe? Am I still willing to talk about it? This one I'm willing to talk about because I'm like, I literally wouldn't have my econ business work the way it does or Milk Road worked the way it did if I didn't use this strategy. So I'm like, I could talk about that. Now what happens when it's like one degree separated from that? Am I still going to want to tell a story on it? Maybe it's not even that interesting of a story. I'm not going to do it. Like, I'm not going to come on this podcast and bore everybody with like a story that's not that great. So I can't I can't commit to that yet. But I don't know if somebody wants me to buy, you know, a minority stake in their business. Hit me up. Let's see. Let's see what happens. I'm gonna try two or three of these and see how it goes. BRIAN RASKINEN",yes
"1:08:19 Shaan: Yeah, definitely. I would say that the businesses that I was most interested in were ones that had a clear sales model, I would say. So they knew how they were gonna get their customers now and in the future. And I don't wanna say moat, cause it's like, you're just trying to be Warren Buffett. It's not like something that had a moat, but they had either recurring revenue or they had something that was like, they're actually the category leader, they're the go-to leader and that there's some reason why they're not just going to get copied into oblivion by everybody else. Maybe they have operational advantage. Maybe they-",no
"1:09:11 Shaan: Yeah. I think Shepherd's real advantage is that they picked a business model that's actually more customer-friendly, like I said. So if your two other options are spend a bunch of time, have a bunch of uncertainty, hire somebody un-vetted, and you save a little bit of money, or pay a 3x monthly upcharge, that you're kind of nuts to do the 3x monthly upcharge for a long period of time, especially if you're going to hire multiple roles and eventually in your company, like just not a sustainable path. To me, Support Shepherd's choice on the business model separated them from the current competitors. Now, somebody else could try to do it, but what are they going to have to do? They're going to have to go set up boots on the ground in the Philippines and in Latin and really be good at recruiting recruiters who are then going to recruit the talent to actually deliver on these roles and hire high quality people. Because they don't really, like the money's not made in your first hire. The money's made when you're like, you see the light and you come back to them for your next six hires. Like what I did with e-comm is like, I started with customer support and I was like, cool, I need somebody who can do inventory forecasting. People in the US really expensive for that, 140K for that role here. Could I find somebody overseas that could do inventory forecasting? Can I find somebody that can run our Amazon ads? Can I find somebody who could do wholesale as a channel? Like, can I find people that do influencer? Like, you start to be like, oh wait, this isn't just about what it used to be, which was like VA's equals low cost labor. Now it's like, Dude, they're pretty talented people that could do these things. They got three or four years of experience doing that at another company. And so you're able to just pluck from the remote talent pool versus just your local talent pool.",no
1:10:44 Shaan: guys have any overseas people yet or no? Yeah.,no
"1:11:17 Shaan: When I was using for our Ecom thing, a lot of Ecom people use agencies. I'll hire an agency and then they're like, great, let's add, can you add these three people to Slack and all of the hands",yes
"1:11:29 Shaan: Yeah. And I'm just like, So like, for example, Design Pickle, I think is like a $10 million a year business to basically like design unlimited designer on demand. We tried them out for a little bit. Every single designer is in the Philippines. Then I hired this email marketing guy. I was like, oh yeah, just do our email marketing at Flows. He's based in Colorado, Every employee is in the Philippines. I was like, okay, that's another one. I hired a website, a web dev shop. Got owners in the US, entire team is in India. Another one that did the entire thing in Ukraine. And it's so funny that people are basically, this is now a business model is basically like, owner in the US does sales, fulfillment all done by, and they're good. I'm not even saying this like a bad thing. Like they're talented, but I'm like, wow, this is a whole business blueprint, a template that they could use to basically like, make the margins work.",yes

"1:13:09 Shaan: Is it a new one? Because the thing I screwed up was the one I rented on Turo was like five years old, and it just needed charging every 90 minutes. It was an awful experience. Well, how fast you go? I mean, it's like highway, right? So you're going like whatever, 75 miles an hour.",yes
"1:13:27 Shaan: It crushes the battery. It absolutely crushed the battery. At least that one that I had, it absolutely crushed it. We had a terrible, we did a seven hour",yes
1:13:35 Shaan: 14 hours because we had to charge so many times.,yes
"1:13:38 Shaan: the way, you know the charging thing? It's not like, you can't just like charge, like there's like certain charges that are fast and some that are slow, you know?",no
"1:13:50 Shaan: charges are. But I'm saying some of the charging stations and some of the spots are fast chargers and some are slow. Like there's a, like it's like a gas pump where one will fill it up and twice the speed as the other. So make sure when you do it, you know that. So you go only to the fast chargers and none of the slow ones. The slow ones are like, you'd have to be like, I wanted to go watch a movie so that I could do this slow charge.",no
"1:14:52 Shaan: Yeah, to an extent, right? Like, you know... This is the one unmissable appointment on my calendar. Everything else is flexible.",no
1:15:00 Shaan: the one non-flexible thing.,no
"1:15:03 Shaan: We missed last week though, so I guess we can't really say that right now.",yes
"1:15:08 Shaan: Yeah, we had a sound issue, but we were like, no days off. People were like, you missed last, the last time.",yes
"1:15:21 Shaan: Big thanks to everybody who listens. This is a fun thing for us to do. Thank you for listening. Yeah, this is like one of the dope parts of our life. And I think it's attracted a bunch of like, I mean, neck-beard nation, right? So It's attracted a bunch of people whose brain is weird in the way our brain is weird. And I think that's a lot of fun.",no
"1:15:55 Shaan: had like,",yes
1:16:07 Shaan: If you're a black guy you are a total man like you didn't even need to say it bro we know.,no
"1:16:44 Shaan: way, here's the etiquette. You come over, you fist pound, not handshake or hug. So let's do Nux, that's the way we do it. We're not trying to be palm to palm with anybody. And so give me the Nux. You can say, you can reference it, you can know small boy stuff, total man. You could use any of the isms that you want. That just means I know you and I'll give you the head nod back, like, yep, you're one of us. Take the selfie together. And then we kind of, you know, we keep the show rolling from there.",no
"1:17:37 Shaan: Oh, my God. Yeah. The more people I'm with, the more I need you to be over the top with it.",no
"1:17:43 Shaan: listen to this podcast. She never heard a single episode. So she doesn't think this is cool. She thinks this is me playing video games up in the bedroom right now. So only when she sees someone come up in person and then even, you know, I was with her mom there and they were like, wow, what? My dad",yes
"1:17:59 Shaan: and he's like, he, My dad literally goes, he must have thought you're someone else. LAUGHTER",yes
1:18:17 Shaan: hi. Particularly if,no
"1:18:36 Shaan: hope there's a fourth. I hope there's a fourth. And so once,",yes
"1:18:43 Shaan: know what I'm saying? The most embarrassing version of this. So when we were selling the milk road, I went to meet up with the guy who bought it, Kendall, at a coffee shop. And we're at the coffee shop for a bit. And I see someone kind of like looking, like I think they recognize me, but I'm not sure. And I'm like, come over, just come over right now. Because he doesn't, was it the pie guys? And I'm trying to do this deal. And I'm like, I think it would help if he felt like I'm a big deal. I was like, I think that'd be a little nice",yes
"1:19:10 Shaan: The guy doesn't come over, right? So we go outside, we say, I say bye, he starts walking away and the guy comes over and he's like Sean and I'm like yeah he goes hey man I literally go I was like oh Kendall I want you to be my I was like hey have you met Kendall and he goes like no",yes
"1:19:31 Shaan: was like Kendall yeah this guy just, he listens to the pod. I just wanted you to, it didn't even make sense. And I was like, I forced it so bad, dude.",yes
"1:19:45 Shaan: How do you take a cool moment and make it the most lame? Was me being like, hey, wait, you didn't hear that he recognized me. Come here. Have you guys met? No, of course not.",yes
"0:00:29 Shaan: bro, to a future billionaire, a millionaire is",no
"0:00:47 Shaan: I said I think that was the best episode of MFM we've ever done. I don't know. I don't know if I'm just on a high right off of it, but I believe so. People can tell in the YouTube comments they should tell us. I, to me, this was the best episode. We've done 400 something episodes. How many have we done Jonathan? Something like 400 episodes. That was the number 1, my favorite, the best episode we've",yes
0:01:31 Shaan: In a great way.,no
"0:01:32 Shaan: He told stories of 2 companies that he's built and the stories were phenomenal. We talked about net worth, what he does with his money, how he thinks about investing. We talked about like how he kind of went from beginner at business and making all the mistakes to now being really sophisticated and how that all happened in a really short amount of time. We talked about his house, the forever estate, the dream that he's been building around and how he does it was we touched it all the buttons had the inspirational, the tactical, the entertaining, the humorous. It had everything that I like in an episode, but in 1. So I couldn't be happier right now.",yes
"0:02:33 Shaan: Give us a wave of feedback. I'm going to send it all to Rob after the pod to show him the love because I know people are going to love this. Without any further buildup, here's the episode with Rob Dyrdek.",no
"0:03:00 Shaan: I am human optimization was the big, the line from his last time he was on. That's been, I think it's like in our trailer now. And Rob, if you are human optimization, I am human on optimization. I am the opposite.",no
0:03:54 Shaan: fun to,no
"0:03:57 Shaan: Okay, that is well played. I appreciate that.",no
"0:06:27 Shaan: There's actually a couple of listeners who after they heard that made their version, They were like, dude, he was talking about this. It sounded so awesome. He said he might share it, but we haven't seen it yet. So I just went ahead and I made my own version. It's linked to Google Sheets. It was a Genki version, but it definitely inspired many people to look inward and be like, how am I treating my time? And it seems like you had the kind of the complete balance. You were like, I have my time that's with my wife and my kids, and then I have my work time and then I have my body, you know, you had it all. So I think that definitely inspired a lot of people to look at it, but it also inspired some people to try to build their own version of that tracker so that they could have the kind of the, the what gets measured gets managed, that type of attitude around their time.",yes
0:08:57 Shaan: as a CEO. Yeah.,no
"0:10:22 Shaan: And Rob, that's you in Photoshop, or this is like a creative agency pitching you guys? How does that happen? You take it, make it tactical.",no
0:15:55 Shaan: That's an amazing story.,no
"0:16:53 Shaan: I think that was my perfect, so that might be the favorite story that's ever been shared on this pod for a couple of reasons. 1, you told it great. 2, it had all of the drama, the elements to it. And 3, you're very honest. Like Most people that come on this pod were like, how much did you put in? They're like, hand wave. We're like, it's doing well now. Then they're like, yeah, it's doing well. But they won't say that last part, which is like, yeah, but it's been 8 years, I got diluted. Honestly, I'll make fuck-all on this. Really the game I'm in, that's good. But the game I'm in is to create X. Very honest, I want people to appreciate that because that is so... We've done 100 plus guests of people from all walks of life. People that are post economic, they already made it. They have no incentive to not fully be honest with the situations, and it is very rare to hear that. So I really, really like that. I got 2 follow-ups for you on things you said there. The first is you said you kind of think maybe he should have gone to Harvard. And I think there's an interesting question that applies to a lot of people, which is like, should I go to college? I kind of feel like, you know, people who make it, they're like, ah, you know, that's not where you learn it. You learn it in the real world. It sounds like you were kind of in that boat, but you said, maybe you changed your mind as you've matured or with your own kids. What's the thinking there? Is it you should have gone to Harvard because the company wasn't working or you came to appreciate something else about the value of college?",yes
"0:19:49 Shaan: You have such little general knowledge of how it all works because you're such an optimist, especially when you're really smart. You can figure things out fast, but there's just too many things that you don't know when it comes to like the complexities of building something like a business. Right. Then my second question was, this is a little nerdy on the protein side, but how did you actually go about creating the cleanest supplement? Because I've thought about this many times, which is there is definitely a market for people who want this the highest quality, purest grade, best for you product. They'll pay the extra 20 bucks per bag to get it. And when you look, I think the supplement industry is notoriously dirty. You know, the places where they make stuff, you know, it's if you test these things, they don't turn out very well. So did you guys do anything radical to actually achieve that result or was it just finding the right partner and then that was it?",no
"0:21:56 Shaan: Yeah, that sounds like the real business opportunity in there. This is Cruelty Free certified ink. We will certify everything for you all for the low, low price. By the way, it's funny that Joe Rogan is like bro Oprah, but now Tuberman is like Dr. Phil or Dr. Oz or something of this guy media game, where if the doc says this is the way to go, if he says this is clean, you know, he can move a lot of product, like an unbelievable amount of product in a short amount of time.",no
0:23:41 Shaan: know what I mean? I just,no
0:23:43 Shaan: What are some other venture creation that you've been up to? That was 1 amazing venture creation story. You got me hungry for another. Do you got any other interesting things you've been cooking?,no
0:29:42 Shaan: water. Nice.,no
"0:31:37 Shaan: What's been the biggest bet? Like where, where have you plowed in something like 10 million into what, what type of bet was that?",no
"0:35:41 Shaan: Who are some of your business advisors, mentors, friends that are helping you develop this muscle? Because you go from, and anything you want to do, you go from a white belt to a blue belt, eventually you can become a black belt. And it sounds like when you started, you were more of a white belt like everybody. And now looking at structures, looking at ways to double dip, looking at ways to, you know, measure, okay, I want IRR, but also I should be thinking about the gross dollar amounts and maybe fewer deals, but bigger deals. Who have you learned a ton from that you respect either as a friend or mentor on the business side?",no
0:36:29 Shaan: Right.,no
"0:38:15 Shaan: What do you think your worth at this point? So you have liquid and you have obviously illiquid. What do you think the kind of the old, the N word, the net worth is at? And do you have a goal with that?",no
0:41:07 Shaan: Right.,no
"0:41:45 Shaan: as a, as a dollar per hour goal? Like what is good for you? What is bad for you? Right? So like everybody has a, like, you know, if I do something that saves me a hundred dollars, I go return a blender to the store. That wasn't a saving of a hundred dollars. It was a loss. I'm looking at a",no
"0:44:28 Shaan: like, bro. To a future billionaire, a millionaire is broke.",no
"0:50:19 Shaan: hold on. Begin to build it in the fall? How long are we... How long are we talking? This has been 8 years and we're on begin to build it? Yeah, forever. This is the take forever estates.",no
"0:53:12 Shaan: Hey, if it lasts forever, what's a decade, man? That's a drop in the bucket.",no
0:54:18 Shaan: me. I love that.,no
"0:54:58 Shaan: Oh my God, Rob, you're amazing. So I was gonna ask you about longevity, like perfect segue, right?",no
"1:00:25 Shaan: So have you seen this guy, Brian Johnson, what he's doing?",no
"1:00:57 Shaan: Dude, that's what I was thinking. I looked up the other day, I'll go, all he needed, all he needs to do is tan. If he tans, everybody would be like, this guy is amazing. He does a tan and they're like, you're, you're a vampire, bro.",yes
1:01:17 Shaan: He's a mid journey.,no
"1:02:00 Shaan: I love the way you think, and I love the pursuit of greatness and pursuit of excellence for yourself and having a vision for yourself. I also know that it's inspiring, but also hard to relate to perfection. I'm curious, what are the current flaws or bugs in your software that you're still debugging. We all have some bugs in our software that's running. We're hunting them down and we're trying to squash them 1 at a time. What are some that are still in your system? It might be in business, it might be in health, it might be in, for me, a nice bag of chips is still a bug in my software. You know, maybe something. Oh, sometimes when I'm with my wife, I'm not as present as I should be. I'm on my phone, but I know that's not really me and who I'm going to be, but I'm still catching up to myself in that way. What are some of those for you?",yes
"1:02:50 Shaan: it. I tried to help you, man. I tried to serve you up a way to be vulnerable here.",no
"1:10:13 Shaan: I believe any trend. Yeah. That the coop guy, he's the I crack guy, right? Same guy.",no
"1:14:52 Shaan: Rob, I wanted you to, can you finish with the 2 minute crash course on something I've been interested in and you know very well, which is production companies. So I noticed, I don't know anything about Hollywood or TV production, but I, my ears perked up when I forgot who it was. They bought Reese Witherspoon's production company for some hundreds of millions of dollars. Then I saw that Peter Chernin from the Chernin Group, he's doing a roll up of production companies, put in a billion dollars to work rolling up production companies. I thought, oh, that's interesting. I read some interviews and he's talking about why he thinks there's a growing and insatiable demand for content. Then I just look at people who create Netflix shows. I go look at, Love is Blind, is ranked number 1 on Netflix. Who created this? I was a small production company. Like, is this like the startup game where you create the next hit show and you become a billionaire or is it a ruthless business? Can you just describe what creating a show or creating a production company is like, and if that's a good business to be in or not.",no
1:21:01 Shaan: Perfect answer. Exactly. I was looking for Rob. This has been amazing. Better,no
"1:21:04 Shaan: 1 somehow. Where should people follow up? Where do you want them? You want them on your pod, your Twitter, email list? How can people get more Rob?",no
"1:22:08 Shaan: So you know what happened? Same man, I know. So basically he came on, he did the rhythm of existence. He sent us the Excel PDF. We post on Twitter and it was kind of over. And then like a year later, I was like, all right, I'm going to start building my email list. And I was like, how do I get fans of the show? The like-minded people, how do I get my type of people to subscribe? I don't just want any subscriber. I want the right type of person. I was like, what would the right type of person be into? And I was like, oh, dude, the Rob, the Rob Dyrdek, the that that rhythm of existence sheet, the time tracker, I think they would be nerding out about that. Like that's my type of nerd. We put it up as a lead magnet, which was like, hey, come put your email in and he'll share his thing with you. We started spending a bunch of money. Rob emails me like, I don't know, 6 months ago, he's like, bro, you're blowing me up with this sheet. You know, it's all good, but you gotta update the photo. You're using the wrong photo from over here. And so we updated the photo and I was like, oh man, I feel bad. We take the whole ad down. We started putting something else up, but it was a moment of embarrassment.",yes
"1:23:20 Shaan: It was good in that we were preaching your gospel and makes you look like a bad-ass. So there's nothing bad there. I just should have asked you first and I had forgotten to do that. I didn't do that. And that's why I felt embarrassed. I was like, Oh, my bad.",yes
"1:23:45 Shaan: Well, there was nothing to convert to, right?",no

You're just covered in buttons. I was like, The problem is not that he pushed a button, you got so many buttons to push. Like you want to be an iPhone, no buttons, nothing to push. What can someone do to you? Now you're unstoppable.",yes

"0:05:11 Shaan: You know what I'd love to do? Because I think that guy's kind of interesting. But I think what would be more interesting is if we have, cause he's kind of, let's say a, you know, an upstart candidate or whatever, like he's like, you know, not the favorite, he's not the leading guy. I would, it would be great if we had two of the upstart candidates come on at the same time. And so we could debate them because it's actually kind of boring when you have one candidate come on and they just kind of monologue their piece for a very long time. Like I've seen a bunch of these guys go on podcasts and frankly, it's kind of boring when that happens. I would love to have like the most pipsqueak debate of all time. It's like us moderating who don't know anything about politics. That's only like half a percent in the polls. And we're just like, it's this is the showdown hundreds of dollars donated to charity",no

"0:07:44 Shaan: The next president will be will be decided off of podcast or something ridiculous like that. Let me let me. Yeah, I'm not like an app. By the way, do we have a little beef with Jason Calacanis? He's kind of sliding into our mentions here. He's coming in a little hot. I gotta say I like Jason Calacanis, but if if you'd like some internet beef, I would happily be the recipient of some internet beef.",no

I was like, yeah, happy birthday to, and I made up a bunch of. Nicknames. I was like the vanilla gorilla, the long arm of the law, you know, whatever the 2% milk himself, Sam par. And I was like, you know, gave you a little shout out like that. Just freestyling. And he replies with the like, think face as if because I think I was like, what the hell is this? What does this mean? And then somebody they were like, oh, I think he thinks you stole his stick from all in where he he gave them nicknames Like the Sultan of science the Queen of quinoa, whatever right and",yes
"0:09:39 Shaan: Yeah, ridiculous. That's a little weird. So yeah, I do think he passes in the head and thinks he's great. But then there's another another hilarious Jason Calacanis moment I got to say from Twitter. So So I just replied and I said, I said, all in, billionaires talking about billionaire shit, MFM, millionaires talking about millionaire shit. And you know, just like, that's a description. So people liked it. And then",yes
"0:10:05 Shaan: go, Oh, they go all in three billionaires and their friend Jason. I was like, Okay, that's a good bird. And then he came back and said, you know, a bottom five lamest thing you could say he goes more like one billionaire and three centi millionaires whatever just",no
"0:10:27 Shaan: you never want to say centi centi millionaire that's like if I had to insult someone with a hundred million dollars, I would call them a centi-millionaire.",no
"0:10:46 Shaan: what that is? That's got big 5'11 energy. I do want to challenge, by the way, I want to challenge the all-in podcast to to a poker game by the way I will play All of the all-in podcast. I'll play a ball heads up and a game of poker So I'll play them heads up. I'll put up $100, 000. And if they beat if two out of the four beat me, they get 100 grand. But if I beat three or four out of the four, I get 100 grand from them. They only have to put up 25K each and I'll play them heads up. We'll live stream the whole thing. You really",no
"0:11:25 Shaan: We'll live stream the whole thing and I will go in order from centi-millionaire to billionaire. So I'll play Jason first. I'll make quick work of Jason and then I'll go Friedberg, Sacks and then Chamath at the end because I think they think Chamath is the best player out of them.",no
0:11:43 Shaan: I'm better than them. That's all they need to know.,no
"0:11:53 Shaan: My nickname is the nuts. And if you know about poker, you know what that means. So we have our own nicknames for ourselves. All right, Let's get back to I don't know why I got on this. Jason, we",yes
0:12:18 Shaan: beneficial to him for sure.,no
"0:12:56 Shaan: In terms of like people who actually like, trust, and will take action on things, Yes.",no
"0:13:21 Shaan: I think you two would do the same. But but yeah, podcast definitely do. I agree with you. I think podcasts are a bit of a little bit of a sleeper still, which is, you know, depending on who you are, but I think people are shocked at how effective podcasts are at swaying opinion. I want to point out a couple other things. So some people are saying, Oh, Joe Rogan, you're just doing this self-serving thing. You're just trying to have this, this freak show, this debate to like pump your ratings. I would say not true at all. Look at somebody's actions, not their words. Joe turned down having Trump on his podcast. He turned down having, other presidential candidates on his podcast that he thought would just kind of be promotional or not a good conversation or bring unwanted attention to the pod, like saying no to Trump is saying no to ratings, especially in the last election when he was when he was kind of on the rise. And he just said, you know, I'd rather not. I'd rather not do that. I'm not sure I'm the right person to moderate that debate. And, you know, I don't think that they would be truthful. I think they would talk talking points, you know, if I had Hillary or Biden on. So I'm not sure that that's that would be a good thing So I think you can't really say that Joe's just doing this for ratings I think Joe actually I think Joe actually thinks RFK I think he actually sides with RFK and says All right If you're gonna say this guy's full of shit come explain why and let him let him argue with you and let's see where it lands. That's the first thing. The second thing is, have you seen this guy, the scientist?",no
"0:15:00 Shaan: Yeah, he looks like a guy like cosplaying Neil deGrasse Tyson. So he So check out this clip.",no
0:15:12 Shaan: I'm not as cautious about my diet as I should be I'm a junk food a hole like,no

"0:15:31 Shaan: I mean, I you know, I you know, I can I have to concede that's the case?",no

0:15:58 Shaan: making my wife stay here,no

"0:16:16 Shaan: Fair enough. Yeah. Not chemicals, they're vaccines.",no
"0:16:23 Shaan: No, they're antigens, right? They're... What's the fluid? Macromolecules.",no
"0:16:29 Shaan: Typically, it would be saline or, you know, salt water. So it's him on Rogan. It's the same scientist, I believe, on Rogan. And in the past,",yes
"0:16:39 Shaan: Hotz. So he's talking and he's talking about vaccines. And he says something about, he says something, but he's very pro-vaccine. So he's like, says something vaccines. And Joe's like, yeah, but, you know, like not everybody feels good. Like putting chemicals in the body. He's like, oh, it's not chemicals. It's a these are antigens. These are cells and he's like, okay. Well, you know what? I mean, like just putting something else in your body. Like, you know, Are you taking care of the main things?"" He asked Peter, he goes, he goes, do you do other things to be healthy? Because Peter's like, he's circular in shape. He's like, well, I dabble in junk food. Joe just starts pressing him. I've never really seen Joe do this But I think he wanted to make a point He's like how how much are we talking like once in a while or like every day? He's like no not every day like so how often and he's like, I don't know like every other day He's like, what do you what do you have? He's like potato chips or you know candy or whatever He's like do you exercise and he's like you basically this guy over like a two-minute period is like, yeah, I eat like shit and I don't exercise. And Jill's like, isn't that crazy? Like, shouldn't you, like, you know better than that, right? Like you're saying people are crazy for not taking vaccines or pushing against them, but like you are not doing the basics of human health. Like you're not exercising, you're not eating in a nutritious way. Like don't you see that that's a problem? He's like, Yeah, I should, you know, no one's perfect. And he's like, he's like, Do you really just love that mouth pleasure so much that you goes in on him",yes
"0:18:11 Shaan: seen Joe do he's like, generally, like, quite like amenable. Like, you know, he's not really doesn't really do that. But I think for him, it is like, you know, he plants a flag around like, you got it. He's like, it's not negotiable. Like, you know, he's like, you know, for me, I travel somewhere. First thing I do is I go to the gym. It's just a non-negotiable. It's just something I do. And then The other guy goes, yeah, I do that too. And I was like, no, I don't think you do that too. You're going to tell him to look at his face. He's like, yeah, but it's different. Maybe the way I'm doing it and the way you're doing it, because look at what's happening here.",no
0:18:53 Shaan: Right. You don't want the bald barber. Yeah. Like I,no
"0:19:14 Shaan: I also think that there's some other strange stuff about this guy, like his daughter has autism and he wrote a book called like Rachel's vaccines didn't cause Rachel's autism or something like that, which I just thought was like a really, I don't know. I can't imagine as a parent doing that. That sounds like just very aggressive.",no
"0:19:33 Shaan: So anyways, I would say, and it's funny to see the debate here, because some people are like, there's on both sides. There's the Rogan, macho bro, which is basically like, yeah, bro, showdown, let's go. But you and me behind the school at 3pm, They want to see a fight. Yeah. Yeah. And they really just want to see him get punked is kind of like one energy. And then the other energy is like, this is stupid. This is not what scientists like trying to bully a scientist into debating when that's not his skill. Like this other guy, he's a politician. He's going to have talking points written for him. All the stuff.",no
"0:20:12 Shaan: Well, yeah, I guess trying to be currently. But they're basically like this one guy is like, you know, this is what he's doing. He's going around talking about the stuff he's been doing. They've been giving talks on the stuff for a long time. And this guy's, you know, trying to just be a scientist. He didn't sign up to be like kind of a debater of the stuff. So that's like the other point of view and they're sort of like anti-bro in that way of like you can't like Stop trying to make this a fight. That's like anti science to do that This one guy who I really like his name is Yi Shan long. He used to be he's like from the from the tech world And he he worked at Facebook early on. He was the CEO of Reddit. Oh, he has",yes
"0:20:56 Shaan: Yeah, exactly. He's trying to change. I like that. It changed climate by by planting trees. I just want to read you what he said. I thought he had a I thought he had a good point. So here he goes. Every science and tech person is currently on the bandwagon calling for the vaccine doctor to go on Rogue in a debate should be ashamed of themselves. If you care about the truth of science, like a kind of a podcast debate is probably the worst thing to advocate for. Usually that argument goes something like this. If you're the Vax Doc and you're so sure you're right, you should be willing to go on and defend it. Otherwise, you lose credibility. That sounds like a good statement, but he's like, it's an example of what Plato, the philosopher would call rhetoric's oral spell. In simple terms, what he's explaining is like, there's a difference between what is actually the truth and what can be said in a very persuasive way. And you should want a medium where it's all about who could be most persuasive. You should want to, if you want to debate to the truth, you should do it in a way where your charisma, your persuasiveness, your loudness, your on the spot thinking is deprioritized compared to just like making your most logical argument and then letting somebody take time and refute it. And he's basically like,",no
"0:22:11 Shaan: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. You, when you hear somebody who's so eloquent, you can, you can conflate how nice it sounds and how persuasive it sounds for how true the actual argument is and vice versa. Somebody can be so dry and boring that even though they're saying something that's really on point, the message is not received by the market. So he basically says, he's like, you know, if you really wanted to do this, this is what you would do. So just to finish the Plato thing, it's basically oratory. So just going in verbally, you know, giving like a speech or a presentation is the medium where you're most likely to have people fall under a great orator's spells. And he's like, people are more like sheep than you want to think. And a great order can get people to do crazy things. If you've ever seen Hitler give a speech or Mussolini give a speech, you can see how a great order, and you've seen it in the good direction of the bad direction, how great order can move people to do something and believe something that may not, they may not have actually believed otherwise. So anyways, his, His point was like, if you really want to do this, they should do it through long form, boring writing. One person should write down their argument with sources cited, give the other person time to respond to each line, each paragraph of that argument. And then you'll have basically both sides of the argument written out. Nobody wants to do this because this is boring. And if you actually wanted the truth, though, that would be the way. And I thought that that was really good. And it reminded me of something that was in companies that I had also seen from from Sean's blog, which was he was like, yeah, in companies, the same thing happens. The person in a meeting who is tall, charismatic, willing to put their opinions forward, basically, they are 100% confident in their opinion.",no
"0:23:59 Shaan: Yeah, Exactly. Sound familiar? No, I'm not holding up a mirror right now. But basically that person is going to like disproportionately sway what actually happens. And actually there's another method. So he basically it's called the Delphi method. And the Delphi method was basically this method where, you bring up a topic. Everybody sort of presents, everybody gets the same set of facts. Then you write down your initial thoughts and statements, and then they're circulated. Everybody reads everybody's initial thoughts and statements anonymously. You don't know who said this, so you can't just say, oh, the CEO thinks this, okay, I guess it's right. You just judge it by the merits of the argument anonymously. Everybody reads it, and then you can go revise your statement based on new information that you got and you update it and you pass it around again until you get to, you know, a sort of like, you know, what people believe is the strongest meritocratic argument after several rounds.",no
"0:25:00 Shaan: Delphi. D-E-L-P-H-I. And there's a couple benefits of this. First, anonymous. So it's not just like the highest ranking official gets their way. Second is it's time delay. So you don't reward time, like for a great decision. You don't need to think of the answer like right on the spot. Like if it takes you five minutes to think of something, five minutes is nothing, but in a meeting, five minutes is everything. You can't just sit there quietly thinking and formulating an idea for 15 minutes or an hour. The meeting's over by then. And so the argument has moved on by then. So this time delay and anonymity is really important. And I love this. And I'll tell you, I shared this with with the CEO at Twitch. And I was like, I think we should do this. He was like, Dude, I love this. This actually would solve one of our biggest problems I think we have in our meetings, which is people think that my opinion is the answer, it shouldn't be. I'm actually usually the least informed on the topic because I'm the furthest away from the data. And secondly, like we reward the loudest mouth and not maybe the most thoughtful person who could have an answer. And it's really hard in a normal meeting setting to get that person to speak. Then I'll give you one more data point. Josh Ellman, who's an awesome dude, friend of the pod. He's a VC plus, like, now he works at Apple. But he was basically like the growth guy at Twitter, the growth guy at LinkedIn, the growth guy at Facebook. Like he like lead growth at like three or four of",no
"0:26:25 Shaan: He invested in discord. He led growth at like four of the biggest consumer hits there's ever been. He for fun, the other, you know, while he's kind of like, you know, just kind of goofing off now, he for fun built this Slack app that does the same thing. He's like, yo, Slack is kind of rewards the same thing. Like whoever's online the most gets to like say the thing in Slack. And He created this app that was like a time delay. So anybody could prompt a question and then everybody has a certain amount of time. Like in the question, it'll say, we'll read the answers in four hours. So anybody could write their answer within the four hour period. What's it called? Oh, Thinking Time is the name of it. So just Google Josh Elman thinking time. It's a slack app and thinking time.org is the URL. And basically it just gave you time and then you could say, all right, here's what I think. I think X and then it tells you all the answers will be released together in 30 minutes. And then in 30 minutes, it posts everybody's answers at the same time to prevent group think. And I just love this because I think these little like nuances actually can really change the way any group of people interact. Because I know I'm guilty of it all the time. I'm loud, I'm persuasive, but that doesn't mean I'm smart. It doesn't mean I'm right. And I actively look for methods or tools to counteract that.",no
"0:28:12 Shaan: you. Good time. Yeah,",no
"0:28:17 Shaan: to a quick one first. I got a simple business opportunity for people. So I don't know if you know this dude, but so Google Analytics, which is the most popular analytics tool on the planet is is just changed Basically shutting down. They're not saying it's shutting down. They're like, it's changing for the worse. Like I would love to see actually, I want to film a commercial on behalf of all marketers out there of the Google fake Google fake Google Analytics commercial where it's like, but what if we made it worse in every way? What if we rethought it and removed all the key functionality and replaced it with a",no
"0:28:56 Shaan: use vague analytics? Wouldn't that be better than precise analytics? It's like, And so people are wondering why I think the reason why is because of all the privacy stuff, the cookie stuff. So basically the same thing that happened to Facebook where Apple changed the rules, the iOS 14 rules, and all of a sudden Facebook ad performance went down and it was like, yo, geniuses over there. Why, why is, why is performance down and why don't you have attribution? Like, why don't we, you know, if I spent a thousand dollars on this ad, did I make 900, 1200, what did I make? Why can't you just tell me that? You know, I put your pixel on my website, you know, your Facebook, you're the biggest geniuses in the world. It's impossible. And the reason why is because now legally they're not allowed to like use this type of tracking that they used before where it's not a technical problem. It's a regulation problem. Meaning The site that serves the ads can't also track the users on third party websites. And this is why portfolio company, triple whale exploded. One of my investments exploded in popularity and is now like, you know, on track to be this huge winner Because let's say you own the e-commerce store and you were using Facebook and you're spending like we spent hundreds of thousands on Facebook ads every month. We have to know is, you know, how our Facebook ads are performing and when Facebook's ability to track that got cut off due to regulation. People were like, what's another solution And triple it was like, Hey, we have this thing called triple pixel. We can tell you more accurately than Facebook how your ads are doing. And so everybody signed up. Triple takes off does amazing. And so I think the same thing happened to Google where Google had to because of the privacy reasons be like, all right,",no
"0:30:36 Shaan: the ads business, we got to just, you know, lick a finger and guess, you know, roughly you got about this much traffic conversion, etc. And so not great. So they're upgrading to this thing called GA4.",yes
"0:30:57 Shaan: After six beers and it needs a nap. Yeah. And every marketer I know hates this thing. And also, nobody knows how to migrate from Google Analytics to GA4. It's like a, there's like, every time you log into Google Analytics, there's literally like a ticking countdown. Like it's, you know, season four of 24. It's like, your analytics are about to explode. You need to go learn this new tool that, by the way, sucks. And you need to migrate everything over because in 14 days, there's no more Google Analytics for you. And so me and a bunch of other people are like, how do you do this? And we try to migrate over, didn't look. We're like, is this working? I don't know if this is working out of the box. And I think right now there's a very simple business opportunity for somebody to go be the GA4 expert, put out a ton of free content and be like, I will handle your migration for you. And you just cold email every business owner that you can think of it, maybe in the e-commerce space, that's where I would start. But if not e-commerce, SaaS businesses, whatever, and be like, hey, do you want to help migrating over to GA4? I'll do the whole thing for you. It's done for you. Turnkey, just pay me $1, 500 And I'll do it. I think you could. I think somebody can make a million dollars in the next six months. Just migrating people over to GA4 and auditing their GA4 to be like, Hey, is this set up correctly just as a one person service business or a two person service business?",no
"0:32:27 Shaan: Pronouns and Google Analytics. What the hell just happened? I take two years off, and business doesn't work the same way anymore. There's no office.",yes
"0:33:10 Shaan: Yeah, yeah. I was gonna say something, but I decided to, to, to, take the high road on on something. I was gonna call someone out on Twitter, but I just decided not to do it. I think you'll know who it is, but I'll avoid it. I got another thing for you. What? How would you like to hear about a business deal that involves one of the goats that involves",yes
0:33:37 Shaan: of dollars that involves a messy divorce. Let me tell you the story about Michael Jordan selling his team right now. The Charlotte Hornets,yes
0:33:47 Shaan: in a roundabout way. So the story actually so so a lot of people are looking at the story right now and they're like Michael Jordan bought this team for I think 275 million dollars and it's about to sell for 2 billion dollars.,no
"0:34:03 Shaan: I don't think anybody. I don't think any of the NBA owners own 100%, but I think he's the majority owner. So he the valuation of the team at the time was 275 million and he bought it and now it's going to sell for 2 billion dollars. MJ strikes again. The goat strikes again. The guy's going to make more money doing this than he ever made playing and more money on this probably than he made through his Nike deal as well. So, found a new way to double his wealth. But What's interesting is actually who owned the Hornets before MJ did. So I don't know if you know, do you know the story? Do you know who the owner was? It's a guy, Bob Johnson. Does that sound familiar? Most generic name erased.",no
"0:34:45 Shaan: Well, do you know the one that was the richest black man in America at a given time?",no
0:34:52 Shaan: guy who started.,no
0:35:04 Shaan: I'm not sure about that. So he starts BT with like a he has,no
"0:35:09 Shaan: of his own money. He puts that in he gets $500, 000 from a guy named John Malone and he's like, look, There's no cable network. There's no channel that caters towards black Americans. He's like, we can do this, we can build this up. They had music obviously. It's basically like the black MTV. They had music, they had award shows, culture, whatever. BET is a winner. BET wins, he sells BET to Viacom for $3 billion, which is just an incredible outcome.",no
"0:35:43 Shaan: They were the I don't know what John Malone got. I don't feel alone or equity, but like, yeah, he owned the majority of it. So after everything is all after everything settles, Bob Johnson is reportedly worth, you know, about a billion and a half dollars, 1.3 to 1.5 billion dollars. And he diversifies, he puts a bunch of money into real estate. He owns hotels, he owns hotel chains, he owns a bunch of different assets basically. But they're all kind of like cash heavy assets. So building hotels, that was a lot. He had like I think a casino type thing or like some, some gambling thing or whatever. He needed money for that. So he's put out a lot of cash. Then he gets divorced. He gets divorced and his wife gets 400 million out of the 1.3 billion awarded to her in the judgment. So that judge made a, you know, gave her a very nice, a settlement or very nice, ruling. Guess who she marries a few months later, the judge.",no
"0:36:47 Shaan: know if it was a few months later. I shouldn't say that Mary's the judge. It's just an incredible. Wow. Incredible. And I was I honestly wasn't going to tell the story till I heard that. I was like, oh, I gotta tell the story just because that is",yes
"0:37:08 Shaan: I don't think so. I think it was done. So, so he, so this happens, he buys an NBA team. So he buys the Bobcats at the time for $300 million. And I think there were like the expansion franchise basically. And so, but they're burning money. So he's losing 20 to $25 million a year. He loses another 200, so he buys it for 300. Then he loses 200 million operating the thing and just operating expenses, which is crazy because there's this famous phrase when it comes to NBA teams that nobody's ever lost money running an NBA team and all the owners claim they're losing money, but it's really just like a negotiation thing against the players. They don't want anybody to know how much money they're actually making or they'll run it at like a slight loss. But the franchise value is appreciating like crazy. So they're like, oh, poor us. How could we ever afford to pay for our stadium? It's like, dude, you bought this for 300 million. It's now worth 3 billion. Like, I think you can, I think you can afford it? So he's losing money. He's got all his money tied up in investments. He's got a ton of debt. He's using a ton of debt to build this thing. He's like, Alright, look, I need to turn this team around. He hires Michael Jordan. So he's like, Mike, come come work for the Bobcats. You're from Charlotte and, you know, come work for the local team. You, you run the team. So he's, Michael's running the team, but Bob is getting stretched for cash. And basically he's got too much debt and his shit's all about to come due. And so he's about to lose his entire empire because he can't come up with enough money to pay off his, his, his note and they're about to take all the collateral. So he's about to lose all his hotels and his, his team.",no
"0:38:57 Shaan: close to a girl. This is where we had our first date. You know why I brought you here. I just wanted to See if you had any of those feelings left for me because I'm about to lose it all so He's about to lose it all And he's like, okay. I need to like sell the team or something But the team is losing money and they're the worst team. They're the sorry-est team So he wants to sell it for like, you know, 350 million or something like that. Can't find a buyer. MJ comes to him and says, all right, I'll buy it. I'm going to buy it for I'll put down 25 million in cash, just 25 million and I want it at a $275 million valuation. So he gets like a 25 30% discount on the team because Bob's under pressure and has no other choice. Basically, he's like, but here's what I'll do. I'll assume all the debts of the team. So I'll get you off this debt, which will relieve the pressure on you. So MJ buys this team for only 25 million down and now is going to sell this thing for 2 billion, which is like a, you know, 100 X cash on cash for him buying this team, which is just an incredible move. And yet another reason MJ is one of the goats.",yes
"0:40:04 Shaan: No, that's not popular. That's a that's a that's a MFM original and MFM classic soon to be copycatted by all of our little fanboys everywhere who will take this and turn this into a thread, a newsletter, a TikTok and an IG reel for themselves. And so, you know, it'll be everywhere soon. The one thing that another interesting twist,",no
"0:40:39 Shaan: Yes, I wrote your hook for you to there's there is more to the story potentially. So The team has sucked ever since Jordan bought them. And like, basically, he actually underperformed, like the team sucked. The franchise values are down. His franchise value should be up more than it is. He so he didn't actually maximize the value on it, but it just shows when you When you buy right, it's hard to lose money at that point. The other rumor is that MJ is only selling the team because he himself owes a bunch of money. That's the other rumor. I don't know if this is true or not.",no
"0:41:32 Shaan: Yeah, that's not the conspiracy is that they killed his father because he owed money and that the commissioner told him you need to take a couple years off because we could suspend you, but that's a bad look for you and us because, you know, of this gambling problem. So you just disappear. So, you know, that's the that's the conspiracy theory. Who knows if that's true. The other version of this is the guy who bought the team now is a gay Plotkin. He's the guy that ran Melvin Capital, which is the hedge fund that the Redditors do the Wall Street bets guys blew up in the GameStop thing. And so Gabe lost like $500 million and that, his fund was about to go under and then he gets bailed out by, what's his name, Ken Griffin. The rumor is that Michael had given Melvin Capital a lot of money, hundreds of millions of dollars to invest on his behalf and that they had lost it. And so he needed cash. And so that's why he sold it. And now he sold it to that guy. He sold it to Gabe, which is pretty crazy. This",no
"0:42:35 Shaan: fat grape. A lot of what I just said is stitching together pieces because people don't come out and say everything, but they do say pieces. And then you kind of have to assume things in between the gaps.",no
0:42:51 Shaan: Air?,no
0:42:58 Shaan: you,no
"0:43:46 Shaan: Yeah, I don't know why that would end when he retires. Okay, yeah. So that's the, that's the Jordan story. Where do you want to go next?",yes
"0:44:21 Shaan: Yeah. One times revenue, which is usually, which is the same thing as five times profit for most of these.",no
0:45:47 Shaan: SEO is screwed. You don't want to be Tony Robinson,no
"0:51:02 Shaan: Yeah, I love it. I think that's great. Nobody talks about trade shows more than you in my life. And I was stunned when I heard about that guy who did Chop Talk, Money 2020, and I think they did the healthcare one. I forgot what that one was called. Those are it's really, really remarkable. I don't fully understand it, meaning",yes
"0:51:25 Shaan: Like let's kind of walk through it. So basically, What's the draw to get the attendees to attend? How do you tell the what is the value prop for the attendees? Is it meet others in your industry? Is it see these vendors up close and personal? Is it listen to these famous people, famous people talk? What is the core draw?",no
"0:52:47 Shaan: But in this one, they were giving away the passes for free. Is that correct? This UK, I think.",no
0:52:58 Shaan: Okay. And then.,no
"0:53:01 Shaan: Right. And so how do they sell those tickets? How do they, how do they build the brand from scratch? Is it content first, free content, then they lead up to it or are they just cold emailing? What do you, what do you know about how that guy, Jonathan Weiner or whatever his name was, how they did it.",no
0:54:15 Shaan: four or five and six. What trade show would we do off MFM? Let's say we could get magically get somebody to organize this whole thing because we don't want to do it. What could we use our distribution for? That would be awesome.,no
"0:54:46 Shaan: the shit that we use. What? It's just like the podcast, the business side of podcasting is just so small. But it's like, oh, man,",no
"0:54:59 Shaan: Yeah, exactly.",no
0:55:02 Shaan: of dollars.,no
"0:55:14 Shaan: Yeah, that's fine. Maybe. Okay. So podcasting is one. What else?",no
"0:55:20 Shaan: Oh, it's not what about what I mentioned. So what do you think? What niche do you think? What type of niche do you think would work? So for example, these guys are doing auto parts and all the automotive industry because it's B2B and a bunch of people are selling high-priced things. We've seen that Money2020 was like, hey, FinTech is going to be a thing. Let's just make the number one... I don't even know if those are trade shows as much as they were conferences, but let's make the FinTech conference. Let's make the e-commerce conference. That's kind of what they tried to do with those to like ride an upstart wave.",no
"0:56:32 Shaan: By the way, we've been to a couple of these. FarmCon, I think, is exactly this. So that's for the agriculture industry. We went to that. Another one is back when I was doing the sushi restaurant, I remember we somehow were at the QSR. I don't even know what it's called, is the QSR event. I just remember that the CEO, the guy who created it, his last name was Hamburger. I was like, I forgot what's the name of that effect where people end up living up to their name. There's a whole subreddit about this. Reddit, people. Was he just",yes
"0:57:08 Shaan: he like? Just basically, just the idea of, somebody who's named John Hamburger ends up creating the quick, the fast food trade show like, you know, Usain Bolt is the fastest man on earth. Like this is just too good to be true.",no
0:57:28 Shaan: This is what he should do.,no

0:57:57 Shaan: It does.,no
"0:58:00 Shaan: You know it's good when I'm slacking in the background, because I'm just like, oh, here's a half-baked idea. Here's a half-baked idea of what could happen. I think the trade shows up is actually pretty fascinating. And I like, you know, I think there's two ways to approach a business. One is like, what do I love to do? And let me just Follow my curiosity, follow my natural, like, scratching my own itch type of thing. And then the other is like, the cold calculating, like, all right, let me work backwards from businesses that sell with high multiples. And I'm just gonna go fishing over there because I don't know what my passion is. So might as well just go calculate the best opportunity. I've actually done both in my life. Both can work. You can win both ways. I think it is better to win when you follow your passion. But if you're not going to do that, this is a fun way to reverse engineer what business you should be in.",yes

"0:00:33 Shaan: but we all do, which is weird. Then you just have to treat it like this, a silent fart in the room.",no
"0:00:38 Shaan: You gotta pretend, pretend you didn't care about",no
"0:00:39 Shaan: it, pretend it's not there, but it's there. And this channel, luckily, is different. This is a channel where we come, We talk about business, we talk about money, we talk about mindset. We talk about",no
"0:00:48 Shaan: a bunch of different things that are interesting to us. And really, the only people who click on this channel are people",no
0:00:52 Shaan: that care about those things. And so it's like when you go,no
"0:00:54 Shaan: to the gym, you can flex and talk about your pecs because the other people there care about",no
"0:00:59 Shaan: that sort of stuff. So, you know, it's understood.",no
"0:01:01 Shaan: So this is the money wisdom channel. I think in the next 15 minutes, I don't think this will be long. I'll be",no
"0:01:06 Shaan: able to go through a bunch of the nuggets I call golden nuggets that I had written down in this. So the first one, I'll start with this.",no
"0:01:12 Shaan: The rich aren't just lucky. So pretend we took all the money that existed and we redistributed it out. Everybody got the same,",no
"0:01:19 Shaan: you know, let's say $100, 000 to start with. 10 years later, I think that most of the rich people would be rich again, because wealth building is a skill and it can be learned. For most people, You want to learn this skill, but you don't know, really know where to start.",no
"0:01:33 Shaan: And I'll give the, I write down these sort",no
"0:01:35 Shaan: of three shifts, these big, big, small shifts that you can make. What does a big, small shift? So I'll give you a quick story. A man wants to learn golf.",no
"0:01:43 Shaan: So he goes out and he buys a, you know, sort of golf clubs and",no
"0:01:46 Shaan: he goes to the driving range, starts hitting some balls and you know, it's going left,",yes
"0:01:49 Shaan: it's going right. Some are going to the center. He can't really control it. Doesn't know how to,",no
"0:01:52 Shaan: doesn't know how to do it. He just started. And so he's like, okay, I need to build the skill, but I don't know how, you know, I don't know what I'm doing to",no
"0:01:59 Shaan: be honest. And so he sees like, you know, in the, in the right next to him",no
"0:02:02 Shaan: in the driving range, there's a coach teaching a kid.",yes
"0:02:05 Shaan: So he walks over, he tells the coach, hey, I'd love to learn. Coach says, happy to",yes
"0:02:08 Shaan: work with you. First lesson's tomorrow morning. Okay, so he shows up again tomorrow morning.",yes
"0:02:11 Shaan: You know, this coach teaches him a",no
"0:02:13 Shaan: few things. Now the coach, he's sort of a, You know, he's maybe 24 years old. He's himself just graduated from college.",yes
"0:02:18 Shaan: You know, he's not the best in the world. He's just the guy standing next to him, but still it helps. He's hitting it a bit better, but not much.",no
0:02:25 Shaan: The ball still going left and right,no
"0:02:27 Shaan: and you know, the man thinks to himself as",no
"0:02:29 Shaan: coach sucks. I don't want this crappy. This guy's a kid's coach. I need a real coach. And so he says, you know what? I'm going to hire the best. Who is the best coach? It goes and finds a professional golfer to be his coach. And this coach gives him some instructions. Within a few minutes, he's hitting the ball straight. It's going great.",no
"0:02:43 Shaan: And so he says, all right, I'm ready",no
0:02:45 Shaan: to go play tomorrow. I'm playing a full 18 holes of golf. Let's do this shows up the next day,no
0:02:50 Shaan: and he's ready to hit the,no
"0:02:51 Shaan: ball straight again. But today things are going different today. It's slicing left. It's slicing right. And he's getting frustrated. And the worst part,",yes
"0:02:57 Shaan: the thing that's frustrating him the most is that the coach is not saying anything. He sort of expects the coach to jump in and fix it, but he coach just watching. So finally he turns around and he says, Hey coach, are you going to, you're going to do something? You're just going to stand there. All right. Like, Oh, look at me. I'm way off.",no
"0:03:13 Shaan: I got to do, I got to change something. And the coach just smiles. Coach says, you know, you think you're way off, but you're really only two millimeters off. He said, coach, no offense.",yes
"0:03:23 Shaan: I know you're the expert here, but pretty sure I'm off by more than two millimeters. The ball's gone 100 yards into the lake here. And the coach says, yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand that. The outcome might be far off, but you're only off by 2 millimeters. You just need a 2-millimeter shift. You see, because when your golf club hits the ball, if it's 2 millimeters angled in the wrong direction, it will Completely change the trajectory of where a ball is going right a small shift in the angle here It's gonna take us in a completely different direction And so he just shows him a couple tweaks watch where you're hitting the ball. Look at the face of the club So he",yes
"0:04:00 Shaan: makes the adjustment takes a swing nails it You know, I heard this story first from Tony Robbins, and I don't know if it's real or fake or whatever, but I love the idea because it really rang true to me. Most things in",no
"0:04:13 Shaan: life, even if you're far off in your outcome, you're actually just only a small shift in",no
0:04:17 Shaan: your approach away because that's what changes your trajectory. And so here's the small 2-millimeter shifts that I think most people need to make.,no
"0:04:25 Shaan: This is after all the money wisdom I collected, they all kind of bucketed into these three shifts that you can make. Shift number one, hard work to smart work. Growing up, we're all pretty much told hard work is the key to success. Our teachers tell us this, our parents tell us this, but we gotta ask, is this really true? Because I look outside, I see the lawn guy mowing the lawn and working in the summer heat. He's working hard. Or you go into any restaurant, go to the back of the kitchen. Look at the line cooks. Those guys are working hard. They're working crazy hours. It's hot out there. It's difficult. They're on their feet all day. They work Saturdays and Sundays because the restaurant doesn't stop. They work hard. And you start to think about it. You're like, well, if hard work equals success, then why isn't my janitor driving a Bentley, right? Because what you work on and who you work with is what matters. It matters a lot more than how hard you work. So again, what you work on, the thing you actually choose to do, and who you work with will make a far bigger impact in your trajectory than just hard work. In fact, there is, hard work does help, but it's maybe the fifth or sixth most important factor in my opinion. I do think there's sort",no
"0:05:31 Shaan: of a minimum, like you need to work hard enough, but beyond hard enough, there's not really like a maximum you should be chasing. The goal is not to work as hard as you possibly can.",no
"0:05:40 Shaan: Okay, so what should you actually work on? Right, I said that's the most important thing. Well, Naval Ravikant says it best. He says, you want to find the thing that feels like play to you and work to others. And you should keep dabbling until you find that because at first you might say, well, what feels like play to me is watching Netflix. Okay, cool, that feels like play to you, but",no
0:05:58 Shaan: it doesn't look like work to others. And so you,no
"0:06:00 Shaan: have to find the thing that is play to you, work to others. For me, for example, it's business stuff. So I am a nerd.",no
"0:06:08 Shaan: I love reading about, learning about business. I like to go, you know, if a stock is, if a company's gonna go public, I'll go read the S1. I wanna read all about the inner workings of the business. To most people, they see this 100-page PDF, and it's like you're digging through to find the balance sheet or the P&L statement. For what? Is your boss telling you to do this? No, I actually enjoy doing that. But to others, it would seem like work. And so that's a kind of a sweet spot you want to identify and really lean into those types",no
"0:06:35 Shaan: of moments. Or this podcast, some people get really nervous about public speaking or it seems like a lot of work or wow, you gotta come up with something,",no
"0:06:42 Shaan: you know, an hour worth of stuff to say every two days about business and don't you feel a lot of pressure? No, no, this feels like play to me. And so if it feels like work to others, but it feels like play to you, those are the, that's the sweet spot. That's what you're looking for. For some people that's programming. Programming can be, you know, a joy to some people and it's a pain to others. For some people it's writing. Like I love writing. Other people hate writing. They think writing is this, they still have trauma from school. They can't stand writing.",no
"0:07:09 Shaan: You know, for my trainer, it's exercise. After he trains me and, you know, four other people, he's been in the gym for six hours straight, where does he go when he's done? To the gym because he wants to get his workout in.",no
"0:07:20 Shaan: It's crazy like that,",no
"0:07:21 Shaan: you know, for him exercise and being in",no
"0:07:23 Shaan: the gym feels like play, whereas to others it would feel exhausting, it'd feel like work. Hell, Marie Kondo loves cleaning. She made that",no
"0:07:30 Shaan: her thing. She loves cleaning,",no
0:07:31 Shaan: but that feels like work to me and many others. So you gotta find that thing.,no
"0:07:35 Shaan: Why does this matter? Because when it feels like play, you'll do it a lot. Not just nine to five, you'll do it from five to nine too. You'll just do it all",no
"0:07:43 Shaan: the time. Any available moment you have, your brain will go in that direction because it's something you enjoy doing so much. And because you enjoy doing it, you'll keep doing it. You can do it for a long period of time, even if you're not getting immediate results, right? There's many things that we will do if we get immediate results. It's the things you're willing to do even without immediate results that lead to these big wins in the end. And you know what they call the guy who practices all the time and never gives up, right? So somebody who does it all the time and can do it for",no
"0:08:10 Shaan: a long period of time, the best.",no
0:08:12 Shaan: That's what they call that guy. They call,no
0:08:14 Shaan: him the best. And The,no
0:08:15 Shaan: best always gets paid in any field. The best plumber gets paid. The best nanny gets paid. The best whatever you are gets paid. And so you want to find the thing that feels like play to you because it will help you become the best. Shift number two. So we've gone from hard work to smart work and that's finding the thing that feels like play to you and work to others. Now shift number two is you want to go from being far away from money to hanging out with money. So let's pretend you want,no
"0:08:40 Shaan: to get a six-pack. To get a six-pack, to get abs, you need to start thinking and acting like somebody who already has a six-pack, right? They make certain choices about how they eat. They make certain choices about, with like, you know, if you travel with somebody who's fit, they got in their bag, some protein powder, resistance bands. They'll pick a hotel based on the gym. They make decisions you don't make because they have a certain set of priorities and habits that you don't have. So you have to sort of think like a fit person to act like a fit person, then",no
0:09:07 Shaan: you become a fit person.,no
0:09:08 Shaan: Same goes for wealth. You gotta think like,no
"0:09:10 Shaan: a wealthy person, act like a wealthy person, and then you become a wealthy person. Most people get this wrong, they laugh about this, like, oh,",no
"0:09:16 Shaan: so I should just, that rich guy's buy, you know, Ferraris, so I should go buy a Ferrari.",no
"0:09:21 Shaan: Not really. You want to find their habits, not their extravagances, right? Not their indulgences.",no
0:09:26 Shaan: You want to find their habits.,no
"0:09:28 Shaan: You want to hang around with them so that you understand what their habits are, the small things they do on a day-to-day basis that make them who they are, and you need to start doing them. So you need to shift your way of thinking to match the type of person that you want to become. All right, so how do you start thinking like a wealthy person? Well, you",no
"0:09:42 Shaan: got to hang out with them, but how do you hang out with them, right?",yes
"0:09:45 Shaan: Like, you know, they may not be around you. You know, what if you don't know anybody? So there's three ways. The first is peers.",no
"0:09:50 Shaan: So you want to find, you know, five people with the same dream as you. Right? Do you know five people who have the same dream as you, who are taking it as seriously as you or more seriously? You want to find those people. You need to create a group chat. You need to create a weekly dinner. Hell, move into a house together. Do whatever it takes. When I wanted to get good at poker, I literally lived with a bunch of other people who were",yes
"0:10:12 Shaan: trying to get good at poker. And all day, we're",no
"0:10:14 Shaan: all playing poker. We're all talking poker over our meals. We're thinking about poker. We're asking each other questions. We're getting inspired by somebody else's success. We're getting bitter about that guy's success, but",yes
0:10:22 Shaan: it makes us work harder. You want to immerse yourself in an immersive environment where you're going to get better. And so get as close to it as you can. Living together is,no
"0:10:31 Shaan: the best. If you can't do living together, get dinners together.",no
"0:10:34 Shaan: If you can't do dinners together, get in a group chat together. Do whatever it takes. The second one is mentors.",no
"0:10:38 Shaan: So you got your peers, now you",no
0:10:39 Shaan: want your mentors. This is somebody who's already done it.,no
0:10:41 Shaan: You can learn from them. The trick here is really simple. What most people do wrong is they,no
0:10:45 Shaan: go and ask for you to be their mentor. Here's what you actually want to do.,no
"0:10:47 Shaan: You want to find somebody who's already done it. You want to ask them a specific question. Hey, I'm dealing with this situation right now. I need to decide between A and B. Here's what I'm thinking. Could you give me any advice on this decision between",no
"0:10:59 Shaan: A and B? How would you think about this? Then whatever they say, you go take massive action on it. And then you follow up, you say, hey, you told me that thing, here's what happened. You know, it either really worked or really didn't work. Here's what I'm doing next. You repeat it. You do that three times with somebody, they're kind of informally your mentor anyways. You never need to ask them to sort of like, you know, be in a relationship with you. It'll just happen naturally by being somebody who asks specific questions. So don't ask them for their time, ask them for their specific advice, then actually take action on it, and then the key, follow up. If you repeat that, you'll have mentors. Okay, the next way you hang out with money, you gotta change your information diet. So if you're already listening to this podcast or watching this video on YouTube, congratulations, you're already doing it. But you need to ask people who have achieved what you want, what do you listen to? What do you follow? What do you read? What are your favorite YouTube channels? My greatest teachers are people I've never met. This is people that I follow from Twitter and books and podcasts and YouTube. They've made the biggest impact on me. You don't need to actually physically necessarily hang out with everybody for them to make an impact. But let's say you listen to this podcast. We release two, maybe three episodes a week. Each episode's about an hour. So you're here with us for two or three hours a week. That's more than most people talk to their mom, that's more than most people talk to their friends, that's more than most people talk to anybody. So you bringing this conversation into your world is changing the type of conversations that you're having. You start to change your conversations, it'll change your thinking, change your thinking, it'll change your actions, change your actions, you change your results. That's how it goes. So these are the three ways that you can hang out, start to hang out with wealth. There's one other one that I didn't mention here, which is When",no
"0:12:30 Shaan: you hang out with wealth, literally you get around people",no
"0:12:32 Shaan: who have done what you did, it gives your imagination more food. So when you, like, I remember the first time I went to a really rich person's house, and I'm like, wow, he's got a chef, and he's got like, oh, this guy just came over and just did that for them? Oh, interesting.",yes
"0:12:45 Shaan: Oh, they're saying that they travel once a month to go do this thing and this charity thing that they do.",no
"0:12:50 Shaan: That sounds really fulfilling. Those stories sounded awesome. It taught me how to figure out what to even want and what's possible, what's achievable. Because when you see it, It's a lot more realistic than just thinking about it or hearing about it. Like, you know, beliefs are good, but an experience is always better. And so just hanging out with people who already have wealth gives you a sort of these, all these like subconscious cues. It makes things feel more realistic. It gives you different things that you dream about. Maybe you don't care about a car. Like for me, I never cared about cars, but maybe I wanted a, like I always thought I wanted courtside seats at an NBA game. Then I saw a rich person with a chef and I",yes
"0:13:26 Shaan: was like, screw the game, I want a chef.",no
"0:13:28 Shaan: That seems awesome, Right? Healthy, tasty food that's being made by somebody else saves you time. That's unbelievable. So that's one other thing about hanging out with money.",no
0:13:38 Shaan: All right. Shift number three. Going from small swings to fat pitches.,no
"0:13:43 Shaan: And I love saying fat pitches. All right. So common mistake most people make. They take small swings, like they take the first good offer that comes their way, the first good job or the first good deal.",no
0:13:53 Shaan: They start too many projects at once.,no
0:13:55 Shaan: I've definitely been guilty of that before.,yes
"0:13:56 Shaan: They chase shiny objects. So, oh, I'm doing this thing. Oh, there's a new thing. Go over there. You can do anything, but",no
"0:14:01 Shaan: you just can't do everything. This is a hard lesson to learn in life. You can do anything, but you can't do everything. And the beauty of this is you don't have to do everything. So Warren Buffett, one of the",no
"0:14:12 Shaan: wealthiest men in the world, one of",no
"0:14:13 Shaan: the best investors in the world, he missed the whole internet wave. Like the last 20 years, basically dominated by the tech industry. He missed it. That's all right. He still ended up doing great. Why? Because he understands Coke and Geico. His fat pitch was companies like that that were in his zone of competence, things he understood that he was able to act on.",no
"0:14:32 Shaan: And you can get rich anyway, right? The beauty of it is you only gotta get rich one way. You don't have to get everything right.",no
"0:14:38 Shaan: You just gotta get one thing right to be rich. Ted Williams, one of the greatest baseball hitters ever, he was famous for waiting for the fat pitch. He would sort of map out the strike zone.",no
"0:14:46 Shaan: He said, all right, all of these are strikes, but you notice that, you know, when it's dead center, I hit 400. But if I try",yes
"0:14:52 Shaan: to hit on the edge of the strike zone, I'm only hitting 230. And so what made the difference between Ted, the greatest hitter ever, and, you know, the average or even above average hitter was that they would swing at the pitches where they would average 230, whereas he would only swing at the pitches where he'd average 400, right? That was his attempt to wait for the fat pitch and only focus on hitting those. And Warren Buffett takes this even further for investing.",no
"0:15:16 Shaan: So he says, unlike baseball, there's no called strikes in investing. You can literally sit there and pass on 50 opportunities straight just waiting for your fat pitch.",no
"0:15:24 Shaan: And somebody asked him, what does a fat pitch look like? Here's what Warren had to say about that. He says, If you look at the stock exchange, it's high, for the last 12 months will be maybe 150% higher than the low, low is the low part of the stock market.",no
"0:15:39 Shaan: He says, all you have to do is sit there",no
"0:15:40 Shaan: and wait until there's something really attractive that you understand,",no
0:15:42 Shaan: and you could forget about everything else. That's a,no
"0:15:44 Shaan: wonderful game to play in. There's almost nothing where the game is stacked in your favor like the stock market. But the problem is people start listening to everybody on TV or whatever talking or they may read the paper or whatever and they take this advantage that you can wait for something you really like, that you really understand and pounce and they turn it into a disadvantage. There's no easier game than stocks, but you just have to be sure you don't play it too often and that's the mistake that people make. They play too often. They swing too many times. They don't wait for the fat pitch and that's why their returns go down.",no
"0:16:17 Shaan: You know, the first 10 years of your career, you probably don't",yes
"0:16:20 Shaan: even know what a fat pitch looks like, even if it was to hit you in the face. So my advice for most people is the first 10 years, just go work with the smartest, highest energy, most resourceful people you can find. Go into emerging markets or exciting fields and just try to do exciting work with exciting people. Because doing that is what's gonna train your gut to actually notice fat pitches. If you're doing that and you're reflecting consistently, you're looking back, you're saying, all right, what did I learn the last year? Looking back, what should I have actually been focused on last year? You'll start to learn, oh wow, there was all these opportunities that were coming my way that I actually didn't recognize to be as good of an opportunity as they were. And so you gotta spend those first 10 years like that to hone your gut, and then after that, you'll be able to notice those fat pitches. Some common things about like what is",no
0:17:04 Shaan: a fat pitch? What does,no
"0:17:05 Shaan: that mean? So like a platform shift, like when the iPhone first came out, there's an app store. All of a sudden there was this new computer in everyone's pocket and nobody had built apps yet. That was a fat pitch waiting to happen. Anybody who jumped on that like Instagram back then, they were able to do very well. Law changes. Anytime there's a rule or regulatory change, that creates opportunity. If there's a new technological breakthrough like AI right now, what people are doing, building on top of chat GPT or GPT-4, that's a fat pitch. Market panics.",no
"0:17:34 Shaan: So anytime the market just panics and sells everything, well, everything's on sale.",no
0:17:37 Shaan: That's a good opportunity to buy great companies. Another one is working at a generational company early on. So if you saw Facebook in,no
0:17:43 Shaan: 2004,no
"0:17:44 Shaan: to 2008, you could go in and be like, look, it doesn't even matter that this is how much I'm going to make off this. You just want to be on that rocket ship. And so there's one of these, you know, one or two of these every decade and being a part of them is, you know that's a fat pitch. The other one is when somebody owns something but they don't realize what it's worth. You know, they have an asset, but they don't really understand it fully or they don't have the right lens, but you do. You know what you could do with it. This happens in real estate all the time. Somebody's sitting on a building, oh, it's only rented out for this much. So they sell it at a fair price for what it's worth. But another guy comes in and says, I know that I can get a new permit to zone this for multifamily and I can build more units on top. And so he's selling it at what he thinks is a fair price. But to me, it's actually a steal because I have asymmetric information. That word asymmetric matters. Asymmetric information is when you know, things that others don't. Asymmetric upside is when, let's say you invest in a startup. In a startup, you invest",yes
0:18:39 Shaan: $100.,no
"0:18:40 Shaan: The most it can lose is your $100. But startups, when they win, they could be 100x or 1, 000x returns. That's asymmetric upside. You can win a lot more than you can lose. And so you want to look for opportunities where you have either asymmetric information or asymmetric upside as a general rule of thumb for how you invest. Now, of course, the likelihood of success matters, right? Like every startup is not going to 100x or 1, 000x. So you want to find those where the probability of them working and the upside make it worth doing. Okay, the other part about fat pitches, you got to swing hard. Most people take weak half swings. And they make a couple of calls or they send you one email, but",no
0:19:18 Shaan: they don't follow up. Or you even give them,no
"0:19:21 Shaan: an opportunity, they don't follow through. You know, don't just sit there and just look or just bunt, right? You got to really swing. And so winners follow up. Winners double down on what's working. Winners get on the next flight out to go meet you in person. And the way I say it is intensity is the strategy. Most people want the magic strategy, the magic formula. But unfortunately, the hard thing to understand is actually intensity is the strategy. Most of the time, the strategy is pretty obvious. It's pretty cut and clear. It's the intensity you take to it that makes a big difference. And so once you find a good strategy, you want to execute it just violently versus trying to wait for the perfect magic formula, perfect magic solution, a perfect strategy that doesn't exist. Here's an example of a hard swing. So there's this guy Taylor Offer. I don't know why this comes to mind, but it's the first one that came to mind. Taylor, he's the founder of a clothing company called Feet Now, but back then he had a merch business. I think he was trying to sell socks or something. And it was going okay, but he wanted to double down so Turns up the intensity. He's like I'm selling merch. I need distribution What if I had the distribution of some of the most famous vine and YouTube stars that existed and the top vine and YouTube stars At the time were guys like Logan Paul and King Bach and stuff like that. He says, how do I get them to work with me? Right? I don't even know these guys. How do I get them to work with me? So he's watching their videos and he notices that all the doors in the background of their videos like the apartment doors had the same handle. He's like, Three of the Viners have the same they must live in the same building",yes
0:20:48 Shaan: So he hunts down he finds a building moves across the country moves into the building and he knows that they like to,no
"0:20:54 Shaan: work out So he starts just working out twice a day He's like this increases my odds of crossing paths with them and They do cross paths. He tells them what he's doing. They get to know each other. Eventually, they become friends. They partner with him. He becomes the first guy to do merch with Logan Paul, sells millions of dollars in merch right off the bat. He basically leapfrogged where he would have been with lower intensity without being willing to double down. And so I love that story because it's an example of all the things I mentioned, right? Working smarter, not harder, of moving towards the people you want, being near the people you want versus being far away. And when you see a fat pitch, double down, swing hard at that thing. So if you remember one thing from this section, it's intensity is a strategy. Winners don't usually have a better strategy, except they do the obvious things with more intensity than you do. And the reality is you don't even know what max intensity looks like until you see it. You need to go work with people who are real winners just to see, oh, that's how they attack when they see an opportunity or they have a problem, how they go and approach things. You got to kind of say what I always say is like, you think the knob of the volume goes only up to 10, and then you beat somebody and they actually, the volume there is turned up to",yes

And then a bunch of people are like, dude, what are you saying here? And they're offended or they're like offended on behalf of somebody else. And then he'll do that again. He'll be like, he'll say, I run my company. I have 20 people that are making $5 an hour in the Philippines, and it's the best decision I made. Hiring my international staff has been an absolute game changer. I'm never hiring entitled Americans who care about A, B, and C again, whatever. Then people are like, are you anti-American? Then they're like, wait, $5 an hour in the Philippines, do you feel good taking advantage of this labor?

"0:04:21 Shaan: He knows Ruffle's feathers. He takes a very polarizing approach to it. I would say in our world, in the business world, this is not common. Elon does it, but not really. He's the only 1 I could think of that's like, maybe there's a bunch of other examples, but on the business side, it's not that common. And the political side, you see it, right? Trump on the political side.",no
"0:04:48 Shaan: think it was, I don't know, maybe it was because his whole business career was pre-social media, so it's hard to say. I think he always was this guy, but when you do it in dinner parties, it's very different than doing it out loud on Twitter, where anybody anywhere in the world can follow you and hate you. Tucker Carlson is like this. All of the media pundits that get really big, like Hannity and whatever, they take a very polarizing view on things. Ben Shapiro. Then you have Andrew Tate. This leads me into a, So first I noticed this mob marketing tactic. I was like, this is very effective. I don't know if I would want to do it. It sounds like it is a lot of firefighting. I've been able to make it work without doing it. So I don't really intend to go do this, but it is 1 tactic that does work. The other thing that I've noticed with this is it ties up this idea I call total man. I think total man is a new lifestyle that is popping up. I'd like to tell you about it. So here's the idea with Total Man.",no
"0:05:50 Shaan: to buy the domain, it's taken. I'd like to own this domain. I think that this is either already is or going to be the next big lifestyle brand trend, is whoever owns this total man thing. I think Andrew Tate kind of did it. So I'm a little bit late to the, to the game here, but basically if you look at the following individuals, David Goggins, Joe Rogan, Jack O'Willink, Andrew Tate, Donald Trump, even Nick Huber to an extent. They all subscribe to this total man lifestyle. What is the total man lifestyle?",no
"0:06:28 Shaan: You're like half of them. Half man. I think you definitely, you're not total man, you're half man. You might be trying to get to that level. Okay, so my trainer even said this, he's like, I'm just trying to live the quality, I want to be a quality man. And I want to have this lifestyle. And I thought, quality man, that's a good phrase. And I said, let me just sharpen that a little bit. Total man. I said, what do you mean by that? He goes, he's like, I just want to have my finances set. I want to have, I want to be wealthy. I want to, I want to be fit. Like I don't want to be out of shape. I don't think it's cool to be out of shape. I'm going to push myself to be in phenomenal shape. I found some other characteristics. He didn't say these, but basically, somebody who's unapologetic. You see this with Nick. When the mob comes at him, he never apologizes or backs down, he pushes back again. Trump does the same thing, Androtate does the same thing, they double down instead of backpedaling. They're unapologetic. Why? Because they live by a code. I think you do that too. They live by a code. It's an internal code and the internal code can be a little bit flawed, like, entertain some wild stuff. But the fact that they have a code is actually quite admirable. I think people are attracted to somebody with a code because they themselves don't have a code. And so it's sort of like, life is easier when you're just around people who live by their code. What else is traits of the total man? The total man does not get caught up in BS drama. The total man does not act like a wussy. So when things, you know, like David Goggins is like, I broke my foot, good. I'm finishing this 100-mile run. The stories they collect and pride themselves on are not about lifestyle balance. Someone came over to my house the other day and she said this",no
"0:08:16 Shaan: to my wife. She goes, it's okay to not be okay. I go, total man would never say it's okay to not be okay.",yes
"0:08:22 Shaan: This is different lifestyles. I think there's 1 lifestyle. Let me keep going. He knows what he wants out of life and then he has it. It doesn't matter if what you want is a Bugatti and 3 model girlfriends. What matters is that you wanted it and you sort of whatever quote-unquote manifested it. I think that's another trait of these people that do this Total man lifestyle. And lastly, they have strong hobbies. Joe Rogan goes bow hunting, you know, Goggins does pull-ups for fun. These people have strong hobbies and lastly, they are charismatic and they care about being charismatic. So to me, I think that you're going to see a bunch of mega influencers and a bunch of brands being built, like in the same way that there's like right wing conservative, like that became a lifestyle and an identity and then a bunch of brands got built for that population. I think you're going to see a bunch of people, you're already seeing it with Andrew Tate and others, David Goggins and others that are trying to do this total man lifestyle and then build a bunch of products for other guys who want to be a part of this religion. I think about this.",no
0:09:39 Shaan: he was actually in the church of the total man would do is go read an Arnold Schwarzenegger biography for fun.,no
"0:10:19 Shaan: Here's what I think is new. I have this belief that like almost everything that becomes a big friend is in response to the world being a certain status quo and the other way. It's a pendulum that swings. And so you had an era where it was like the world was very conventional and traditional and blah blah blah. And then you start to see a bunch of unconventional, untraditional things. And this is people having different genders and pronouns and purple hair and all this stuff. And you see a big movement in that direction. Then you see, I would say, therapy and empathy and all these words have never been more popular amongst men and women. I think in response to that, I think there's an undercurrent of people who feel like it's all too soft. The world's getting too soft. We need hard men. We need the total man. And so here's how I know it works. Everything I described is the opposite of toxic masculinity. It is basically being a man became something that got labeled as toxic masculinity. Now I think there's a bunch of people trying to take that back and be like, hell no, we embrace masculinity. That's what I see happening is people basically flipping that on its head and be like, I'm not gonna apologize for being manly. In fact, I'm gonna double down on it. And then there's this wave of people who have been craving something like that. And I'll give you the example. I remember when Snapchat came out and I underestimated Snapchat at first. I thought, oh, disappearing photos for kids and is this just for bleep pics? What is this? Is this going to be a real deal? What I underestimated was that Snapchat was the response, the pendulum had swung. When Snapchat came out, Facebook was basically at the peak of its powers. Or it had sort of like, was Facebook and Instagram were at the top. And what Facebook and Instagram were, were every photo is public, every photo is permanent, every photo looks good, and just trying to make you look cool. What was Snapchat? It was the exact opposite. It was every photo is private, every photo is impermanent, and because of that, you get to be silly, you get to let your hair down, you get to just send goofy pictures instead of pictures that make you look cool. And so to me, the need for a product like Snapchat only came out because the world had got so Instagram-ified, so Facebook-ified, where everything was public, permanent, and pretty. And so I think that you see this, anytime you notice that the world goes in 1 direction, you could anticipate that 2 or 3 years later, the counterculture response is going to be there. The opposite is going to become popular. This is a way for me to get, when I think about how to be ahead of the curve on trends, I start to think about what feels dominant today. And in 3 years, what would be the opposite? Because I think there's going to be an emergence of that counterculture. What do you think of this? Am I just doing fake astrology there trying to piece things together?",no
"0:13:25 Shaan: I looked at the buying 1 because I made that. Why? Because we're so well, I guess explain what it is. But it's like we're so heavy.",yes
"0:14:27 Shaan: or whatever is going to know this thing and be like, yeah, duh. Like When everything goes to skinny jeans, guess what's coming back next?",no
"0:14:34 Shaan: The bell bottoms and whatever, the baggy stuff, the high-waisted loose stuff or whatever.",no
"0:16:08 Shaan: Totally, yeah, I think that's totally true. So yeah, I think this, I'm keeping an eye on this and I think that they've been very successful. Like David Goggins is kind of like stunningly popular now and same thing with Andrew Tate.",no
"0:16:23 Shaan: You saw Andrew Tate, did you see Andrew Tate came out of prison and did an interview? Did you see this interview on BBC?",yes
0:16:30 Shaan: Well there's a the full thing got posted on like rumble or something like that. Like,no
"0:16:56 Shaan: So for example, yeah, the BBC, so it's a woman, She comes into his home and she's interviewing him. She goes, how can you say these things that are toxic and dangerous? Whatever you've been named by the UK Commission committee of whatever, as the most dangerous man in the United Kingdom. He's like, dangerous man in the United Kingdom? He's like, what am I preaching that is so dangerous? He's like, I'm Muslim, I don't drink, I don't do drugs. I tell people, don't drink, don't do drugs. I say, work out. I say, work hard, get rich, and build yourself into a quality individual who lives by code. He's like, that's what I preach. What is dangerous about that? She's like, well, you said on an interview that If your wife does OnlyFans, you're entitled to half her earnings or whatever. Or like that, if your wife is your wife, that she is your property as a man or whatever. He's like, did you listen to the actual interview? She's like, you said that, that's what you said. He goes, yes, but what's the context of the interview? The context of the podcast is, me and several women on a podcast were joking around because 1 woman says, if my man owns a car and I'm dating him, that's my car. I own that property too. Then he's like, basically as a joke counter, if I'm dating a girl and she has an OnlyFans, then I get half of that too. He's like, well, the same logic. That's what I said. She's like, so you're saying it's a joke? He's like, yeah, I'm saying you're taking it completely out of context. And he's like, you know, he's kind of like trying to defend himself and they're arguing back and forth and he's like, he asked her a question and she's like, no, I'm asking the questions here. He goes, no, no, no, you're in my house. I invited you here. I'm doing you the favor. You know, you're begging me for interviews and, I let you in here. We are equals. You do not hold any authority over me. We are equals. If I ask you a question, you can choose to answer. If you ask me a question, I don't have to answer either. That's how this is going to be. It's a conversation. She was rejecting that premise And then you hear their handlers in the background that are all like getting really nervous about how the whole thing's going because it's like going off the rails.",yes
"0:19:10 Shaan: Yeah, he has people who are like, you know, I wouldn't say maybe handler is not the right word, but like, you know, he has this like kind of whatever is PR type people that were like, he's answered the question already. You repeated the same question 6 times, just move on to the next thing. You're stuck here. He's not going to answer it any differently. He's answered it 5 times now, just move on to the next question. They were like, you could hear these voices in the background, in the unedited version. Like even they take a break, they're like, how are we going to get the camera? Camera died. We got to reset the batteries. Hold on. And then you could see what happens in the break. She like immediately is like, no, this is making eye contact. She's like looking at her notes only. And then",yes
"0:19:48 Shaan: And his answer was like, we don't have to do this. It's fine. It's fine. No, this is good, actually. I want people to see how this goes. He's like, I want people to see her. Like how the mainstream media, they don't do their research, they lie, blah, blah, blah. He's got his spiel. But during the break, there's like maximum tension is like that's actually probably the most interesting part of the whole interview.",no
0:20:16 Shaan: I'm,no
"0:21:12 Shaan: had a funny experience with this. So when we got acquired by Twitch now in a 2000 person organization in Twitch. Literally, I think 5% of the staff has like, you know, purple hair like it and I don't mean that as an awkward. I just mean like we're in San Francisco. We are the stereotype of when people talk about like kind of like left leaning social media companies. Like people think this about Twitter or Facebook. I would say Twitter probably more like that in terms of the staff. So I'm in a meeting and I joined like 3 minutes late, as I do, as you know that tend to be 3 minutes late every time. There's a presentation on the screen. I don't really understand what's going on. I'm like, what is this presentation about? I slack somebody and they're like, I would say just updating our copywriting, whatever. I'm like, oh, copywriting. I love copywriting. What are we talking about? It was talking about how we use genders from now on. It's like we only say they, and then they were talking about women. They're like, we don't say women, we say, and they spell this word, W-O-M-X-N. I was like, how do you even say that? What is it? What is that? Or is it just women? What do you say for that? This is now how we say this. I was like, what does that mean? Sorry, dumb question. Who's offended and what does this mean? It's like, this is inclusive of people who were maybe not biologically born women, but now are women, and so this is the inclusive term. I was like, how do you say this? All of a sudden, I could feel a bunch of heat on me, like, why are you asking all of these questions? There's an undercurrent in the way I'm asking the questions, which is like, are you sure? That's all I was like. I was like, wow, this is overnight, we're just changing? We don't say that and now we say this, this is a pretty big change. I'm hearing this and I'm like, okay, I guess that's cool. The funny thing is the company that tweeted out for International Women's Day, they tweeted out International Women's Day or whatever, they tweeted it out like that. Then they got tons of blowback from the LGBTQ community being like, don't use that phrase, just call us women. Why are you trying to make us seem different? And I was like, oh my God, they backfired. Like their attempt to placate actually backfired. And I was like, wow, this is really, this is, there's a bunch of landmines. Like, You don't even know.",yes
"0:23:36 Shaan: You can't ask that. But I was like, I said it in a different way. I said, we're talking about like, you know, questions. I was like, Amazon has this thing where when you are doing your yearly planning, 1 of their questions is what are the dogs that are not barking yet? It's from this old Sherlock Holmes story of like a crime occurs in a house, there's a break-in and there's no clues and Sherlock can't figure it out. He fears it out because he's like, well, the dog was here, So surely the neighbor heard the dog and they're like, no, the dog didn't bark. And he's like, ah, that's it. That's the clue, Watson. And he's like, what? He's like, if the dog didn't bark, it's because he knows who the intruder was. That means this was an inside job. And so he figures out who it was because there was the dog not barking. So they have this thing in Amazon, which is when you're doing your annual planning, they say, what are your dogs not barking? Basically, like, what are you not hearing that is actually telling you something? Or it's a different way of saying, like, what is something what is something that's not being said out loud, but could signal something that's worth talking about? And. So I said, I go, I think we should decide how woke we're going to be. And like, where is there a line and what does that mean? And who do we want to be? We should say it out loud, what we want to be. And then literally my slack just blew up and like DMs me like, like abort, don't say this, don't, like, don't bring this up. Like, what are you saying, dude? Like, this is like, you know, a suicide mission. And 1 girl goes, she goes, She goes, I didn't appreciate that. We don't use the word woke anymore. And I go, I go, we who like there's a company policy. You can't use the word woke. I was like, I don't even mean it as an insult. Like I thought it's just like a yeah, because at the time it really wasn't. This was many years. This is like 4 years ago or 5 years ago now. Woke was woke, became a little bit more drugged over time. At first it was stay woke. It was like the kids were saying it as like, yo, you're not awake to what's really going on.",yes
"0:25:28 Shaan: Yeah, it was like a positive thing and then it turned into a kind of system later. It was somewhere in the middle of that, and I was like, we should decide what we're going to do. And she's like, we don't use the word woke anymore. So I appreciate if you don't do that. Who's we? Is there a committee that decides what words we can say? Like that sounds pretty non-woke to me. And she links me like a Vox article. I'm like, oh, you read this Vox article, and you decided that I can't say this? I was like, this is just too much for me. I was like, there's only 1 piece of advice that I needed. There was a piece of advice I got on this podcast from a guy very early on, Daniel Gross. He's super smart guy. He got acquired by Apple and I go, what was that like in that acquisition? You were there for 3 years. What was the best advice you got about navigating that? And he goes, don't give yourself brain damage. And I go, what? He goes, yeah, when you get acquired, this is a really tempting thing as an entrepreneur to like, I'm gonna, I see things that are wrong in this organization or that I want to be a challenger voice and not just like another person who just follows the company line. I'm going to challenge maybe our innovation cycle or our policies or anything. I'm going to be the 1 who brings change. He goes, it's just brain damage, don't try it. I was like, I'm doing it, I'm giving myself brain damage.",yes
"0:26:38 Shaan: It ended with that 1 person telling me that we can't say, say these words anymore, which was backed up by nothing. And I was like, Oh, cool. So you read this article. And so you decided that I am not allowed to ask this question. I gotcha. Just clarifying. Great. Thank you. You know, whatever. Head of. Important thing inside the company, like, yeah, I'm glad that you're rather this is how this this this works. And you know,",yes
0:27:15 Shaan: Someone in his position with his name and face. What would they say?,no
"0:27:19 Shaan: I can't speak for him, but I guess my impression of it was basically, I think he's mostly shielded from this stuff. So like, I don't think that most of this gets to his plate and that by the time it does.",no
"0:27:32 Shaan: Like, I think he's like a Renaissance man. He's a little different. I think 2 things. I think 1, I think he's mostly just like, he, I think he's gotten a lot of CEO coaching to where he doesn't let his first reaction be his response. So like something comes up and now instead of reacting, he responds and he usually responds with a question and he'll just ask them tons of questions. And he's like, I'm in the spirit of literally understanding what you're saying and trying to figure this out, tell me what does that word mean? And they'll be like, it just means inclusive means. And he's like, well, like, no, like, can you please like use an example? Or can you like, from, can you explain that from like, you know, base principles? Like, what are you talking about? Where, what are the boundary lines? Like, let's make sure we're all talking about the same thing and he does look kind of like a Socratic method where he would he would end up just like fatiguing out anybody who wanted to bring something up and he would get his understanding of it and then decide is this important or not but I think most people are sort of intimidated by him. And then in the process of trying to debate him on something would sort of like, nobody could really, a very few people in the company could really like hold up to any debate or any scrutiny from him in a conversation. I saw it just many, many times and he was trying to dial that down because he knows that that's like, you know, already he's in a position of authority. Plus he's like a, you know, world-class debater who's got this like wide breadth of knowledge to like pull from. So he already knows he's like, you know, if he does that, he's going to shut people down. So he's trying not tries not to do that but I saw you know most people didn't want to bring it up to him.",yes

"0:30:15 Shaan: He wrote an email to the staff about a trend he noticed in the workforce, which was new hires had to introduce themselves using their preferred pronouns. He says, this is completely unnecessary for a woman who is clearly a woman to tell us that her pronouns are she and her, and a man who's clearly a man to tell us those pronouns are he and him. He understands that the practice is rooted in kindness, but he says, in the long run, this approach does more harm than good, because you're forcing people to behave a certain way, and that's the opposite of inclusion. He says, first, there's a tiny number of people at, well, he says peeps, so already, that's a fireable offense. It's a tiny number of peeps at MailChimp who are considering themselves transgender, forcing either with orders or guilt, the other 1, 390 other peeps adopt a new communication time that immunity has never had to use in our 300, 000 year existence and our 150, 000 years of spoken language in order to make things slightly more comfortable for an extremely small group of peeps is completely illogical. So then he got fired.",no

"0:33:23 Shaan: All most I'm talking about the ancillary things right now, but they're all crushing it. The platform is crushing it. The stars are crushing it and the the cottage businesses that can build around this to help this to be a part of that ecosystem. But they're doing so well that I sort of, if I talked about them, I would be coming between them and like millions of dollars because people, a lot of people would want to compete with the strategies that they're doing. But I will say 1 thing that I've learned that was pretty interesting. So I always assumed that OnlyFans was popular because you're sending like, I don't know, nude pics or videos to guys and that's like the thing. That's what they're paying for. And I was always a little curious. I was like, porn's like free on the internet. Why would you pay for this? And I go, there must be something, I don't know. And I just kind of wrote it off as that. Do you know why they make so much money? Do you know what the actual moneymaker is inside of a, of an OnlyFans account when these girls say that they're making like a million dollars a month? You know what actually drives that?",no
"0:34:25 Shaan: You know, I'm a married man and I did not do that, but you didn't need to because I talked to the people who like run, they like run the accounts or whatever. Like What a lot of people don't realize is that a lot of these accounts are just, they're bought. So a girl has a public persona, she does an OnlyFans. She gets exhausted running the thing because it's like a lot and it's emotionally exhausting dealing with all these guys and whatever. So somebody approaches her and says, we'll buy your account for, I'll give you $200, 000 right now for your OnlyFans account. Then I'll give you X percent of the profits and I'll run it. You just have to put pictures in a Dropbox folder. You give me good content and I will give you money and that's how it goes. And then, and so what actually people, so I was like why do people pay for these pictures and videos? Like again, porn's free. That's like 1 of the rules of the internet is porn is free. So what do people really want? And it turns out that they want like the girlfriend experience and so they not through the content but through the chatting and that the chatting has all kinds of weird things like",no
"0:35:36 Shaan: And so they hire farms of chatters So basically what OnlyFans is built off of like a lot of the money is made through is giant like customer support you know, call centers essentially in the Philippines talking to, you know, it's basically like dudes in the Philippines talking to dudes in the US pretending to be the girl and so they, it's just like They have this army of chatters that will chat with these guys and tease them, and flirt with them, and then upsell them, and boom, cha-ching, got the sale. They're like salespeople. They get commissions and all this stuff. It's insane. But how? Within that, okay, so 1 of the highest ticket items, If this was the county fair, what's that stuffed animal at the top? It's basically like the number 1 is pretend to be my girlfriend for a month. It's like, text me as if you're my girlfriend. That's the top prize. But there's other weird stuff underneath. We're so weird that I can't even say this. This is a family show. And so I can't even say some of the weird stuff that they want, but it's not what you would think. It's not like super.",no
"0:36:45 Shaan: Like I'll give you 1 example. 1 example is the guy who's the customer sending pictures to the only fans person asking for their opinion or rating of them. And that's like a service that they pay for. And so there's stuff. And I guess like The 2 things stood out. 1 is, it's like the free market at work, baby. It's like you can really see what humans are all about when you talk to these people because it's like, man, people are into all kinds of crazy stuff. These are like their real desires and These are desires they wouldn't admit. I bet a bunch of these people, they're doctors and they're the CEOs, and they're other people. Human desires got revealed. They were always there and they got revealed because OnlyFans gave a better avenue to realize those desires, which is crazy to me. The second thing is, I think it's wild how much money is being made in this space. My reaction to it is not like, I think you were asking what's your reaction to?",no
0:37:59 Shaan: not involved in,no
"0:38:03 Shaan: I'm learning. I'm talking to these people because I find it fascinating. I have contemplated investing in some of these because I would not want to operate this. But if you're already down there in the sewer, Let me know if you got something. I'll hand it up here. You know, like I will provide resources.",no
"0:38:23 Shaan: it hypocritical? I'm saying I don't personally, I would not personally enjoy operating this. I also would not like operating a deli or an ice cream shop or whatever, but I'll go, I'll go eat a scoop. What's the problem with that? If they need resources, they need capital or they need advice. I'll give them those things. I don't want to operate. So to me, that's fine. My wife, I",no
0:38:50 Shaan: I told my wife by the way I was like hey I'm thinking about this and she just goes okay don't tell me but if it makes money that's,yes
"0:39:03 Shaan: yeah I would also say that it's really funny. I find it amusing the way that the ecosystem works, where it's like what you think it is, is some woman with an account who's putting up content, and guys want that, And then she's chatting with them. And it's like, actually this like whole other thing, there's agencies that control the accounts. The agencies are 90 percent dudes. The chatters are like, you know, these call centers in India and the Philippines. And I find it amusing. I'm like, that's hilarious that that's what this like, that that's how this like evolved. And I find that",no
0:39:55 Shaan: Right.,no
"0:40:01 Shaan: you see it because 1 of their main growth tactics is they pay meme accounts. So accounts that just post funny jokes, 99% of the time, the way that those accounts make money is OnlyFans people will pay a lot of money to get posted 1 time at night on those accounts, and then you can delete it in the morning, and that's how they grow their own social followings, and so through these meme distribution channels. So that's a funny part of it. But anyways, I don't even know. I didn't plan to talk about this 1, but that's a funny little tangent.",no
"0:40:47 Shaan: he actually, he actually, you know, has been alive through all of history yes he's mad",no
0:41:21 Shaan: **,no
0:41:22 Shaan: **,no
"0:42:27 Shaan: do a great job, I would say.",no
"0:42:31 Shaan: win them all, it turns out. Can't win them all. Can't win them all,",no
0:43:13 Shaan: It was,yes
"0:43:14 Shaan: like, at their peak, they had more agents than the standing American army. Is that true? That's insane.",no
"0:43:36 Shaan: You know, I thought that Mighty Ducks, Ducks Fly Together was the top, but we don't sleep might be better than Ducks Fly Together.",no
0:44:15 Shaan: at their website. Have you been to their website? No. For Tim.com. It just says our story. And there's literally a picture of Abe Lincoln. That's the hero image. Do they have a home? Talking about owning your failures. These guys love,no
"0:44:39 Shaan: Nobody, nobody fails faster than us.",no
"0:44:44 Shaan: Risk advisory, investigations, protection, embedded SMEs. I don't even know what that is. That sounds...",no
"0:45:51 Shaan: It's the security. It's a security thing where you like it's a security camera where it'll talk, you know, like there's like a human watching on the other side.",no
"0:46:26 Shaan: have heard of this. It's like bodyguards, right?",no
"0:46:35 Shaan: Well, I",no
"0:47:07 Shaan: way, here's the price. Unarmed guard, $59 an hour, armed guard, $98 an hour, off duty police, $145 an hour, and they're armed. That's it. That's it.",no
0:47:34 Shaan: know how much they sold for it? Is that or do you know anything about their revenues or anything like this is a crazy business?,no
0:47:46 Shaan: Founder's alive? Yeah,no
0:47:49 Shaan: How long is he alive? 1850? No!,no
0:47:56 Shaan: Pinkerton.,no
"0:48:01 Shaan: How much? Well, you said they sold to somebody, right? Was it like?",no
0:48:07 Shaan: 99.,no
"0:48:43 Shaan: No, that sounds good though.",no
"0:49:34 Shaan: I'll give a quick shout out to this genius restaurant. So this guy Joshua Goodfield tweeted this out. There's a restaurant that basically named all of its like the number 1, the number 2, the number 3 office supplies. So it'll be like mini dry erase board or like pack of pencils so that you can expense.",no
0:49:51 Shaan: You can expense on all meals from this restaurant. It's called,no
"0:49:57 Shaan: Yeah, exactly. I thought that was a genius little marketing hack. So shout out to that. And then dude, are you watching the NBA Finals? I got a little human interest story for you.",no
"0:50:14 Shaan: It's pretty crazy. So the 2 teams that are in it, it's Miami Heat and Denver Nuggets. So the best player on both the teams have just like crazy backstories. So 1, this is the guy in the heat, Jimmy Butler. He have you ever seen the movie The Blind Side?",no
"0:50:31 Shaan: It's his life. So The guy got kicked out of his house at like 13 and was just crashing on friends' couches, and then this white woman just took him in, and she just joined their family. He's like, yeah, she didn't have to do that, she just did it. He calls her mom, her real kids are his brothers and sisters. That's just the way it was. He was not, unlike the blind side. With the blind side, it was pretty clear this guy had NFL talent. He was just a freak athlete and was huge. Any coach would tell you that. Not to say that's why she did it but like it was kind of like possible but Jimmy Butler was like it wasn't like he went to junior college then he transferred to Marquette and then he barely got into the NBA and now he's a star but like it was not obvious",yes
0:51:28 Shaan: Good things happen,no
0:51:29 Shaan: to people.,no
"0:51:32 Shaan: this woman. This woman that took him in single mom also. So single mom with 7 kids did this, took him in, basically put a roof over his head and he ends up grinding his way to the NBA. And this doesn't make the thing. He also was doing something really, really funny. So back when COVID hit the NBA to keep the season going, they had to create a bubble. Many sports had to do this. They created a bubble, which was like a... Didn't they do it",no
"0:51:57 Shaan: Yeah, at Disney World, I think. So they did it in Disney World in Orlando. It was like, you live on campus, nobody comes in or out. Like if food gets delivered, it gets delivered in a sealed box 30 feet away and it gets given to you. They just tested everybody daily, and if anybody ever had anything, they got kicked out. During that process, Jimmy Butler realizes, you know, supply and demand is out of whack. So he starts, he's making coffees. He brought a fancy coffee machine and he starts making coffees. And people are like, yo, can I get some coffee? Like the coffee here sucks. I want the good coffee. He's like, yeah, cool, man. It's a hundred dollars. It's half a hundred dollars. He's like, that's the price. He's like, these are players who cannot leave this bubble. And so, and they're like, all right, man, fuck it. And they just start giving them a hundred dollars for this coffee. And so he creates this brand, I think it's called Big Face Coffee. And now he's like, so he, and during the bubble, people want to know what it's like. And there's a lot of the guys like vlogging. So this was like 1 of the storylines, you know, Jimmy opened up a coffee shop. He's just like, you know, killing us on this coffee. And he's like, yo, I make the best coffee. It's the best coffee in the world, $100. Now he's creating a spin-off brand of actually that coffee brand which I think is cool.",yes
"0:53:11 Shaan: The giant white guy, so in Jokic.",no
0:53:16 Shaan: all town in Serbia. Sombra Serbia.,no
"0:53:25 Shaan: That's funny. That was the owner of another team. He basically bullied an owner of another team. So this guy, he's awesome. So basically his story is even crazier I think. So this guy's born in the middle of nowhere, Serbia. He's got 2 older brothers and he's, even though they're really tall, he only likes 1 sport, horseback riding. So He just falls in love with horse. He's always on the horse track or whatever. But because he's so tall, like when he wasn't on with the horses, he starts playing basketball. What's interesting is that nobody would have ever known to this guy except for the fact that there was 1 team that had a business model. Their business model was basically, let's find prospects that might have NBA. We don't care if we win now, but let's just find big dudes who got a lot of potential that might get bought out by the bigger clubs. And they're like kind of like house flippers. They're like, let's buy this guy. Let's see if we can turn up, like polish up the asset and let's flip them to a bigger team in Europe or let's hold their rights and maybe we get there and maybe the NBA team have to buy us out. And they've done this with a couple of guys. And so the guy's reading the newspaper 1 day and he sees that at some youth basketball game like say some eighth grade game some kid you know had like 25 points at 25 rebounds and he's like huh so he goes and he finds this guy and he's like hey you ever thought about playing pro basketball he's like no and he's like come with me so at like I don't know age 13 he like leaves his hometown and joins this like team. And they're like, so you're, so then you think the story is, cause he's the best player in the NBA now. So it's like, he must've been,",yes
0:54:59 Shaan: the world right now. And so,no
"0:55:01 Shaan: He's like 7, 7 foot 1, something like that. So they're like, you would think, oh, he must have been dominating in Serbia. Then he went to these Tier 4 league. He must be awesome. No, he didn't even play. The coach was like, this kid is so fat. He is just so out of shape, I will not play this guy. He's only allowed to go to practice, and they're like, until you can run, until you're in shape, it's not going to work. He's like, what do I do? Well, what's your diet? The guy was drinking 2 gallons of coke a day. He was addicted to Coke. He just loved drinking Coke. And so they were like, you gotta stop that. Like, first of all. And, and so he, he stops drinking Coke. He loses like 30, 40 pounds in the course of like a few months, just by changing that, like 1 habit and going and running every day in practice. Cause he won't, they won't give him the ball. He just have to run on the side while everybody else practices. And so he's doing that. Finally, he, starts playing. He becomes the top player on his team. Like as soon as he like was able to get in shape. He was the top player on his team. And he gets drafted in the second round. Like basically he's like 1 of the last picks. The NBA draft. If you go watch the video of like, Oh, I want to see when they got drafted. Like you've seen when LeBron gets drafted, he gets on stage. He shakes the commissioner's hand. He smiles. The light bulbs are flashing. Like people know this is the start of the stars born.",yes
"0:56:23 Shaan: Even better, they just cut to a Taco Bell commercial and at the bottom ticker, it just said pick number 41, Nikola Jokic, it just goes across the screen, it goes away and it's a cheesy Gordita Crunch ad. He didn't even have that starting moment because nobody thought this guy would turn into anything. And then he's basically become the best player in the world.",yes
"0:56:43 Shaan: He's only like 27, 28, something like that. He's pretty young still. And he actually wouldn't have even made it to the NBA. Like this team in Barcelona was going to buy him. That was going to be the flip. It was like, he goes from the Serbian team to the Barcelona team. And the day, like the day before he was supposed to sign the contract, like it was already, the lawyer just had to finish 1 thing. He played in a game and He was so terrible that the team backed out. So he had no choice but to go join like the NBA team that had bought his rights or drafted his rights. He's like, I guess I'll go to the NBA then. Like, you know, I don't really know if anything's gonna come of this, but whatever. And so he goes and he's this very stoic guy, like in all his interviews, they're like, they have these narrow, the media has all these narratives. They're like, how is becoming a new dad helped you become a better basketball player? And just look at them like what it does. That's not how that works. He's just like he's like just very matter of fact, like, you know, like you like the kind of like Dagestani guys in the UFC. He's kind of like that, but for basketball. So he's a fascinating character. It reminds me of this quote that I heard from this VC. I was like, you know, what's he had this Twitter bio, this guy, Nico, Nico. I don't know how he says that. I was saying, bon santos, bono santos. I don't know exactly how you say it.",yes
"0:57:52 Shaan: Yeah, from GC. Exactly. The guy, he invested in Snapchat super early on. And I was like, Nico, why is your bio, why is your bio quote what it is? And his quote was, talent is everywhere, opportunity is not. Talent is evenly distributed, but opportunity is not. I was like, what does that mean? He said, because it's true. He goes, talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not evenly distributed. If I do my job right, we're going to distribute opportunities more people who have the talent. I think about both these guys, the 2 guys that are starting the ABA, they're 1 little bounce of the Plinko chip away from it being a 0. Instead, they get to be world famous basketball players. It's like if this guy didn't get discovered while playing in like a youth farm league in Serbia or Jimmy Butler didn't get adopted by this woman, like who knows if they would have ended up actually even getting their shot. And it's like, that's how fragile, like, you know, like success and failure can be.",no
0:58:54 Shaan: Yes.,no
"0:59:06 Shaan: that wasn't going to be broadcasted otherwise,",no
"1:01:28 Shaan: No chance on the gold medal. Well, best athlete",no
"1:01:31 Shaan: in the world. Yes, I would do that.",no
1:01:32 Shaan: That's but,no
"1:01:38 Shaan: and you're like overall athlete. No, no, no. If it's if it's I'm the fastest miler or NCAA, you know, nation, you know, national champion or whatever. No chance. I've said this before. The Olympics are for suckers.",yes
"1:01:58 Shaan: you guys are the best bobsledder the world has ever seen. You've dedicated your entire life to this absolutely arbitrary thing that got you nobody, that got you no skills beyond this. I'm just joking.",no
"1:02:23 Shaan: That's what I want to do. I want to play a game where the 100, 000th person wins and has an awesome life. Not where I have to be the best person in the world. And even then, I gotta start over at age 27 and create a new career because I'm done with the thing and my joints don't work anymore.",no
"1:02:54 Shaan: Cool. His business advice was great, but then he said he wants to put butter on my chest. I didn't understand that.",yes
"1:03:17 Shaan: you said to your wife, dude,",no
1:03:48 Shaan: That's a Prince Sam loving men.,no
"1:03:58 Shaan: Yeah, I guess you, I guess you do.",no
"1:04:02 Shaan: Yeah, definitely not the way you'd Like, there's been several people that come on this podcast and I'm like, I'm pretty sure Sam's just imagining them without their shirt on right now. I feel like Sam does that, like pretty frequently.",yes
1:04:32 Shaan: feel like I can rule the world I know I could be what I want to I put my all in it like no days off On a road less traveled never looking back,no
"0:00:06 Shaan: Okay. Friends, family, people who like pink pop tarts. Welcome. This is another masterclass. My first masterclass was on raising money.",no
0:00:14 Shaan: It was about how to create,no
0:00:15 Shaan: a killer pitch deck. That's the,no
"0:00:16 Shaan: start of your journey. If you're an entrepreneur, you're trying to go raise money from investors to fund the company.",no
"0:00:20 Shaan: This is now about the end of the company. How do you sell a company? Ben asked me to do a masterclass. He's like, hey, can you record a masterclass today? Your boy's lazy. So I'm repurposing a presentation I gave three, four years ago at HustleCon. I went on Google Drive, I found an old presentation. I actually didn't even look through it. I'm just gonna do it live here, sort of",yes
"0:00:40 Shaan: improv style. But I remember, I remember being on stage and giving this talk about how to sell a company because I had just sold my first company.",yes
"0:00:46 Shaan: And I remember at the time being like, I wish there was some more content about this because if you wanna learn how to manage people, there's tons of books and you're gonna get practice every day. If you wanna learn how to grow revenue or sales, there's tons of books and you",yes
0:01:00 Shaan: get practice every single day.,no
"0:01:01 Shaan: When it comes to selling a company, there's very little content out there that I thought was any good. And you get very few reps.",no
"0:01:08 Shaan: You might sell a company once every four years, 10 years. It's not a common thing that you do. And so, if you don't practice, you're not very good at anything. So I learned something, some things during the process of selling my companies, and I'm gonna share them with you today. So let's see what I was thinking four years ago. The only thing I did was I removed the HustleCon banner at the bottom and I put a new logo there because it said HustleCon 2019. I thought that would not look so great. So let's jump in and hit the first slide. Here we go. I've sold two companies now, one to a big company. So when we sold a Twitch Twitch owned by Amazon, so selling a company and Amazon was one way, And then Milk Road, we sold to two private buyers, just like, you know, two dudes who were independently wealthy from their previous businesses. And it was a, it was a totally different transaction. So I'm going",yes
"0:01:55 Shaan: to share some lessons from each. When I made this presentation, I had only sold Bevo.",yes
"0:02:00 Shaan: So I added the milk road one just before I went live here, but the rest of the presentation, I didn't add any lessons. So let's see if I've learned something the second time. I always start with this when I come to selling a company. This is a, this is a picture of a foot in a dog and it is the first picture ever posted on Instagram, Kevin system, the founder of Instagram. He posted this right when Instagram went live. And, you know, today it's this like iconic picture of like, you know, this is how it all started. And, you know, here's the guy himself, Kevin Systrom looks great,",no
"0:02:29 Shaan: you know, power pose, got the white sneaks. And if you're Kevin Systrom, you know, you got a dozen employees, you make a billion dollars. Everybody loves",no
"0:02:37 Shaan: you, right? Because you've built the hot thing and everybody comes knocking at your door, right? If you ask Kevin Systrom, how do you sell your company? He'd say, well, you got to create, you know, a sensational product and then people will just come and offer",no
"0:02:49 Shaan: you a billion dollars, right? Like that would",no
"0:02:50 Shaan: be his experience. My experience was very different. We had built a good, not great business. We had built a good, but early business, and we were trying to sell. And so here's what we experienced.",yes
"0:03:01 Shaan: So if you're, if you're reading this or if you're watching this, you are not Instagram. And I think my talk will",no
"0:03:06 Shaan: be maybe a little bit more applicable to you than, than what you might hear from the people that are on the Forbes list. Cause they're, they were in a totally different position of leverage and bargaining power than most people are when they go to sell their business. This is you. You've tried, you've pivoted, you've hustled. It's not working",no
"0:03:22 Shaan: or it's kind of working or it's working, but you're just tired. You're ready to move on. And this is a very common thing entrepreneurs get to. And when you're here, it's okay to think, you know, where should I go? I've been there, I felt it myself. And this advice I heard all the time was, great companies are bought, not sold. That sounds pretty cool. It's a nice little fortune cookie, but remember, You're not Instagram. And so great companies are bought, not sold. I think that's true, but most companies",yes
"0:03:51 Shaan: are sold, not bought. That's my contention, at least. And that was my experience. We sold the companies more so than we just immediately got bought because we were just crushing it beyond belief. Like you would, like you see when, you know, whatever, huge companies get acquired. Here's a headline from when we got bought. This number is incorrect, which just shows you don't read, don't believe everything you read in the media. I don't know where they got that exactly, but yeah, we sold, we sold for, you know, eight figures, but not like that. And sales, it's weird when people come up",yes
"0:04:20 Shaan: with these numbers too, because",no
"0:04:21 Shaan: it's like you get cash up front, then we got",no
"0:04:23 Shaan: these signing bonus, you get stock, then the stock price changes. There's all kinds",no
0:04:27 Shaan: of ways to sort of like manipulate sales numbers. But let me go back here.,yes
"0:04:32 Shaan: When you got started, you thought this is",yes
0:04:35 Shaan: going to work and this will be big if it works and I can do this. And I want to do this more than anything else. That's typically the mindset of an entrepreneur when you start. And the reason I say this is because the first thing when,no
"0:04:47 Shaan: it comes to selling your company is figure out do you even want to sell? That's why I started here. Do you even want to sell? Because when you're in this state of mind, no way you would sell. Why would you sell? This is going to work. It's going to be huge. I could do this and I want to do this more",no
"0:05:00 Shaan: than anything else. That's how you should feel when you start a company. And then you have to check in and say, all right, you're seven and try not to check in on your most frustrated day, but you wanna say, do I still believe this",no
0:05:11 Shaan: is gonna work? Do I still believe this will be big if it works? Do I,no
0:05:15 Shaan: still believe I can do this.,no
0:05:16 Shaan: And do I still want to,no
"0:05:17 Shaan: do this more than anything else? When we sold our first company, we had hit this, all of them kind of were true, except for this will be big if it works. I thought we might have a medium-sized exit the first time. And that's why I decided, well, let's sell now versus play this out for four more years and hit a medium-sized exit.",yes
"0:05:34 Shaan: Yeah, it'll be multiples more than where we're at today, but it still requires four more years and time is so precious.",no
"0:05:40 Shaan: With Milk Road, it was more of the last one.",yes
0:05:42 Shaan: I wanna do this more than,no
"0:05:43 Shaan: anything else. It was actually working and I thought it could be big, but my brain was wandering to new ideas, new things. And I was loving doing the podcast so much. I just is this the one thing I want to wake up and do every day and focus on with laser focus? Yes or no. So these are the questions you got to ask yourself. Say are these more true today less true today or at the same as when I started.",no
"0:06:03 Shaan: And that gives you this takes you this point, right? When should you sell? So if you get a great offer cool consider it if you don't believe in the business anymore. Well, maybe sell the assets because if you don't believe you're not going",no
"0:06:15 Shaan: to really take massive action. You don't take massive action. You're not going to get any results. And then you'll just reinforce your belief. Like, see, I knew it.",no
"0:06:21 Shaan: I knew it wouldn't work, right? So belief is really, really key. And lastly, the common case is you just don't want to run",no
0:06:26 Shaan: the business anymore. You prefer to exit versus hire an operator and you're ready to move on,no
"0:06:31 Shaan: and do other things. So three moments where you might sell. Who do you discuss with? I just wanted to put this up here for a second. So you're talking about it with yourself and maybe some mentors, but then yourself and your partners, yourself and your co-founders. It's really a lot of conversations in your own head, which is",no
0:06:45 Shaan: why managing your own psychology during a sales process is the number one most important thing. It's what helps you be good in negotiation. It's what helps you get people across the line. It's what helps you stand up and operate every day while you're also trying to sell the company. It's very difficult to do that. So managing,no
"0:07:02 Shaan: your own psychology is really important. And then there's a note about your investors and your team. There is a finesse you want to do with this. Some people believe, don't tell anybody until the deals are done. Some people say, well, no,",no
"0:07:14 Shaan: I want to be transparent with my team. For me, I've always been on the be transparent with your team, but",no
0:07:18 Shaan: it does have drawbacks. People start to work,no
"0:07:20 Shaan: a little bit differently when they realize, oh, we're gonna try",no
0:07:22 Shaan: to sell this thing. What does that mean for me?,no
0:07:23 Shaan: Should I be looking for a job?,no
0:07:24 Shaan: Is this what happens if,no
"0:07:25 Shaan: we don't sell? Will I be rich? What's gonna happen? And so I think discussing it with your investors or your team is something to be very careful about. I probably erred too much on the transparency side. I if I was going to go play it back now, I would only discuss with my co-founders and I would not talk to the team until the deal is done.",yes
0:07:43 Shaan: And so you want to create,no
"0:07:44 Shaan: a little like communication table. So your co-founders, you want to tell them ASAP, you know, hey, it's time to explore options. I'm going to do X. You can help me by doing Y. Investors, you want to tell them and say, hey, we're going to explore a sale. Here's what I think would look like. Employees, you might say, hey, we've been approached. We're considering it, blah, blah, blah. Here's the good news. Here's what it means for you. I wrote, you know, you can put ASAP. You can say this, we're going to do this when the deal closes. You can say that we're going to do this when the deal's getting close to closing. You know, you, you want to decide your timelines and create your communication table. Okay. Now to the fun parts. How do you actually sell the dang thing? So who's, who might buy you? You want to break it up into buckets of potential buyers because you're really going to run a sales process. No matter who you are, you become a salesman when it comes time to do this. So I would say there's four potential buyers. There's the unicorn. So high growth companies that might want to buy you to accelerate their growth. There's dying dinosaurs. So, you know, incumbents that might need to get fresh blood, fresh tech, fresh energy, fresh cashflow, whatever it may be. There's your adjacent companies, your adjacent alligators. This is like a",no
0:08:46 Shaan: was a game of Legends of the Hidden Temple. So you got the adjacent alligators there next to you. They might be peers or competitors that you merge with. And the last one is talent farms.,no
"0:08:55 Shaan: This is just go sell it to Google and they just want talent. So they don't care about your company or your market, but they just want engineers.",no
"0:09:02 Shaan: You have to also know the different roles. Who are you going to be talking to? So when you get bought, the other side is",no
0:09:07 Shaan: going to have an exec champion. So who's the one person that really wants this deal to happen?,no
"0:09:12 Shaan: If you can't identify that person, ain't no deal going to happen. You should always know who is the person that is pounding the table on",no
"0:09:18 Shaan: that side saying we got to do this deal. Or, hey, come on, let's figure out a solution to that problem. Or do just let's bridge the gap. Let's come up a little bit. Right. You need to know who is the champion on the other side, identify them, and you're going to nurture that relationship. You got to know who's the company router, Who's the person in the middle that can get you to the different people that need buy-in. Usually in big companies, it'll be corp dev, but in smaller companies, you might know who else it is. Maybe there's a admin person or assistant. Who are you gonna be able to reliably get information from and to that's not necessarily the key decision maker.",no
"0:09:48 Shaan: And then you've got your deal doula. So this is using a childbirth metaphor. So if you're trying to birth this baby, you know, a doula who helps you,",no
"0:09:58 Shaan: you know, remember to breathe, think about this, you know, let's move to this position, it's",no
"0:10:02 Shaan: going to help, Hey, we need to get water here. Your doula is",no
0:10:05 Shaan: the one helping you through this often painful but wonderful process. And so I like to find my deal doulas.,no
0:10:13 Shaan: These are one or two people who,no
"0:10:14 Shaan: have done M&A before. They're in my corner. I can trust them that there'll be keep everything confidential and I'm going to bug the hell out of them. I'm going to, you know, these are people that I was texting and saying, Hey, I'm going to say this back. You know, is that too desperate? No, no. Okay. Let me, you know, wordsmithing it. Like I'm a, you know, seventh grade girl trying to figure out, do they like me, do they not like me? How do I phrase this in a way that demonstrates strength without pushing too far? Your deal do list will help with that.",yes
"0:10:40 Shaan: For those who love one of the greatest shows on earth, this is the Dennis system. So I'm",no
"0:10:44 Shaan: gonna take you through the Dennis system of how to sell your company. So stage one, the D demonstrate values. So why do companies buy companies? There are financial reasons and then there are strategic reasons. So financial reasons, obvious you're crushing it. You're making tons of money. They want your EBITDA. They want your revenue. Pretty straightforward. If you have it, Many people don't.",no
"0:11:04 Shaan: So who buys companies when there's strategic reasons? Well, here's six strategic reasons. The CEO finds it interesting. That's the first one. That is surprising how far",no
0:11:13 Shaan: that goes. CEO's got a,no
"0:11:14 Shaan: pet project, CEO has got an itch to scratch. Awesome. If you're so lucky to have that, fantastic. Number two, there's a new executive or an executive gets a promotion and they need",no
"0:11:23 Shaan: to demonstrate big moves as a signal. So they're on the way out or they're on the way in and they're looking for some kind of big move, some big thing to do as a signal. That's good for you when that happens. Number three, they're trying to catch up to a surging competitor. You know, this is Adobe, you know, using Figma to catch up. There are many examples of this along the way. Synergy, one plus one equals three. This is Uber merging with Didi in China so that they don't keep competing each other driving costs up. They say, hey, why don't we merge into one entity? And then we own a monopoly. We can cut costs. Actually, we can raise prices. So one plus one could equal three in",no
"0:11:56 Shaan: this case. They're afraid of you. This is Facebook buying Instagram. You know, you do what they do, but better. Instagram was better at sharing photos than Facebook.",no
"0:12:03 Shaan: And okay, you're going to get a strategic premium when that's the case.",no
0:12:07 Shaan: And the last one is you,no
0:12:08 Shaan: have unique talent. So you might have computer vision PhDs and they're having trouble finding that talent in mass. And it's actually cheaper to acquire you and get the talent as a bundle that's proven to work together versus going through,no
"0:12:18 Shaan: a long, slow recruiting process. And so it's important to figure out for every potential buyer what might be the reasons that they will buy you. Next step, E, engage physically. So who do you actually reach out to?",no
0:12:31 Shaan: What do you say? And what's the goal?,no
"0:12:33 Shaan: You know, you can reach out to a number",no
"0:12:34 Shaan: of folks who are executives. Just go meet somebody who's at the company. Corp dev, their job is to meet companies that might be interesting to acquire. Investors might make introductions. You know, when we were selling, we went to a, I went to an investor who was an investor in discord. And I said, Hey, we got this thing discord. I want to buy it. And he",yes
"0:12:51 Shaan: said, let me email the CEO, CEO gets an email from their biggest investor.",no
0:12:54 Shaan: They're going to take it seriously. And then all of,no
"0:12:56 Shaan: a sudden I'm, you know, next day I'm in a meeting with the CEO and I'm pitching. Why this, why one plus one can equal three. There's also advisors.",yes
"0:13:04 Shaan: What do you say? You know, you say, hey, I want to discuss a partnership on how we might be able to work together intent, right? Like that's discuss a partnership is the best way to kind",no
"0:13:12 Shaan: of open the door. The more aggressive way which I've done also is hey, we got an offer. We're, you",no
"0:13:17 Shaan: know, we're considering our next steps. Maybe we're going to raise money or we have an acquisition offer. I would love to talk to you before we just go and make a decision. And they say, oh,",no
"0:13:25 Shaan: yeah, yeah, come talk to us first. Don't just don't just do it without",no
"0:13:28 Shaan: you know, we want to take a peek under the hood. We want to know our options before we get in. Your goal here is just to get an in-person meeting. And so, you know, use these two frames in order to get an in-person meeting. Now, what do you",no
0:13:40 Shaan: do if you don't know them?,no
"0:13:41 Shaan: Well, you got to reach out. You got to reach out cold. Ideally, you've been building a relationship over time. This is the smart way to do it is you meet people in the company, you keep them posted with light updates. They see you, they know you, they see you at an industry event. So that when the time comes, you can do this. You're not an absolute stranger approaching them. But I've done it as a stranger too. Usually when I'm a stranger, Corp Dev is",yes
0:13:59 Shaan: the easiest way to go.,no
"0:14:00 Shaan: Next, N, nurture dependence. I'm covering some of the words here, but you want lust, not love. Lust is a high burst, immediate, like, oh, I see, it's like greed. It's like, oh, I want something out of this. Your goal is to tap into emotions. And when I say this, it's about clarity, not trickery. You're not going to manipulate anybody into buying your company.",no
0:14:20 Shaan: What you can do is frame what you're doing in,no
"0:14:23 Shaan: a way that is maximally appealing to them. Something that taps into their desires, their dreams, their emotions, their pain points. And you",no
0:14:32 Shaan: need to trim the fat of your story so that you are the answer to that problem.,no
"0:14:39 Shaan: I'll give you an example. When we sold to Twitch, I had met, in terms of engaged physically, I'd gone through CorpDev. CorpDev had got me a meeting with the CEO the next day. And I said, all right, well, I",yes
"0:14:50 Shaan: don't know what to, I don't know how to",no
"0:14:52 Shaan: frame what we're doing to the CEO. But I had met a guy on a boat in Australia of all places who worked at Twitch, he was an exec. I said, I gotta hit that guy up. So I",yes
"0:15:00 Shaan: hit him up and I said, hey, can I get",no
"0:15:01 Shaan: a beer with you today? He said, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, let's do it.",yes
"0:15:06 Shaan: I said, I got a meeting with the CEO tomorrow. I don't know how",yes
0:15:08 Shaan: to navigate it. You know the guy. Can I just get a beer with you just to get you down though? So I go get a,no
"0:15:12 Shaan: beer with him and I say, you know, what's he like? What's he, you know, what should I expect? Blah, blah, blah. And then I said, tell me, what are the top like three, when",yes
"0:15:21 Shaan: you're in these exec meetings, you're, you know, you're, you're at the highest level, or I'm stroking the ego. You're, you're, I know you're in the room when they're making the big decisions. So what are the top three priorities? Like, what do y'all really care about? Is it profitability? Is it revenue? Is it growth? What are the top three priorities? And he'll say them. I said, okay. I said, which one of those is like stuck? Which one of those needs a solution? Because like sometimes you already have a solution in mind. You love that solution. You don't want to interrupt it. But which one is still, we don't really love our plan here feels the weakest and need some bolstering. And then he told me, Hey, we have this thing and actually everybody's pretty bullish on it, but we",no
0:15:56 Shaan: don't have the right team and we don't have the tech to do it.,no
"0:15:59 Shaan: And the guy we have, he's not good with tech. So it's going to be a problem. I said, oh,",no
0:16:03 Shaan: say less. So then when I,no
"0:16:04 Shaan: go into the meeting the next day, I say, we're great at doing this one thing. And I'm a great leader and",yes
"0:16:09 Shaan: I know tech. And we have the team that, we have the tech already built. And I have",no
0:16:12 Shaan: the team that built it. And so now I package my story as how I am the solution to their problem versus what most people do is they come in,no
"0:16:20 Shaan: as a startup and say Here's what we do. Here's why we're great. You know, here's this other feature we have here's this feature we have and oh this guy says this They're all over the place",no
"0:16:29 Shaan: and it's like, all right good for you, but that doesn't tell me why I want you. So it's a sales pitch. You gotta package yourself as the solution to their problem.",no
"0:16:37 Shaan: Another way to say this, you need to find their pain, offer a cure. You know, other questions that might be helpful. What initiative has",no
"0:16:43 Shaan: the most juice or momentum or buy-in right now? You wanna, buy-in is like the best word with corporations. What has all the exact buy-in right now? Oh, they're all bought into this idea. What are the fires that need putting out? Who's on the chopping block? What company are you guys most afraid of? If I only had 20 minutes in front of your CEO.",no
0:17:01 Shaan: What part of what we're doing do you think he'd be most interested in talking about? And then you also want,no
"0:17:06 Shaan: to suss out, who's the decision maker? So, hey, right now",no
0:17:08 Shaan: we're talking to this guy. Is he the decision maker or who should we be,no
"0:17:11 Shaan: talking to? And oh, no, no, no, no, his boss's boss is",no
"0:17:13 Shaan: the guy. Then you want to talk down, this is a little pro tip, talk to founders who have been acquired by",no
"0:17:19 Shaan: the same company before. So go to them, say, hey, you acquired three years ago, four years ago, whatever. What was it like? How did the process go? Were the timelines that they told you real or fake? Was the, when they said this is the most we could do. Was that real or fake?",no
"0:17:31 Shaan: Did they try to retrade the deal later or not? What was your experience with the CEO? Was he really into it? Was he, is he more reserved? What did, what did that mean? You're trying to get",no
"0:17:40 Shaan: a bunch of intel and, hey, this is founder to founder from somebody who, you know, has done it before. Ideally who's left the company now. I got a ton of great intel on this.",no
"0:17:49 Shaan: Okay, here's another. This is just",no
0:17:52 Shaan: a classic move when we did it. You wanna do the work for them. So what a,yes
"0:17:56 Shaan: lot of people do is they say, here's what we do. Then they sit there and they pray. I hope they understand it. I hope they get it. I hope they like it. No, through that, you take matters into your own hands. So you basically say, hey, I wrote up a one pager that explains where I think this makes a",no
"0:18:15 Shaan: lot of sense strategically for you guys, because if we're going to do this, then I want to make sure, you know, I thought about this from your perspective and what this would look like once we join, you know, I did some crazy things. So basically on the technical side, I had our team write a technical one-page rule. Here's all the stuff we built, how long it would take for anybody to build it. What's our special sauce so that they could just see, man, buying this is going to save us so much time. Look at all these assets they already have. Who's the talent. Here's my, I made our team a present, like into a presentation of like, here's all the talent we have, what they've done before, make it really easy for them. It's a dating profile. Do I want to swipe right or left on these people? And then I, I think I wrote a letter from the CEO. I said, I said,",yes
0:18:54 Shaan: I think this deal makes a lot of sense. And I wanted to write that out into,no
"0:18:57 Shaan: a memo. I know you guys have this memo writing culture. Like Amazon has this thing, like you write six page memos for all your strategies.",no
"0:19:03 Shaan: So I took a stab. I wrote one,",yes
"0:19:05 Shaan: you know, I, obviously I don't know some of the internal things. So I, you know, I took guesses they're, they're in blue. You can see the guesses, but yeah, I wanted to put my logic on paper. Cause I don't want to do this. If this doesn't make sense, right. You're not saying please, please, please buy me. You're saying I'm trying to figure out, does this make sense for both of us? It's a two way street. And so in order to do that, I wrote something to give myself clarity. I thought you'd like to see it. And so I actually wrote for one of the acquisitions. I said, this is how I would announce this deal to the company, to the team, to your exec team and the rest of the employees. And I just wrote a really persuasive argument of like, we bought this company. Here's why, here's why this was a good idea. Here's how awesome this is going to be. Here's the, how this solves one of",no
0:19:45 Shaan: our problems. I'm so excited about this acquisition.,no
"0:19:47 Shaan: And like in doing so again, I made it easy. Somebody told me this, one of my deal duels, he goes, you need to turn your company into a giant buy button, like a, like Amazon one click checkout. So that means make it easy to understand what you do, make it easy for them to understand your team, your technicals, your your strat, how you strategically align. And last thing you get your get all your financials in like very clean, proper, you know, data room, so that there's no friction and trying to buy your company.",yes
"0:20:16 Shaan: Last one, neglect emotionally The Dennis Reynolds special. So you need to find another partner. You need to go cold, all right? You don't want to be all in hot on one partner. That is not how you get the best deal. So you need to find multiple partners at the same time. You need to be negotiating these in parallel. You don't do one at a time. You start the process,",no
"0:20:33 Shaan: you know, you starting conversations with 10 folks at once, 20 folks at once. You're narrowing it down. You're trying to get multiple offers in the same week so that you can tell them, Hey, we got another offer. Sometimes you",no
"0:20:42 Shaan: go cold a little bit, make them sweat. Not too long. Don't push",no
"0:20:46 Shaan: it, but it's not a bad thing. I also leave breadcrumbs. I don't know if this made a difference or not, but I would like check in on my Instagram story like I'm in Seattle.",yes
"0:20:55 Shaan: Oh, cool. I've never been to",no
"0:20:56 Shaan: the office, to this cool office before. And like they know that, Oh, he's at Microsoft. He's at Facebook. He's where is he? He's talking to he's talking to our competitors. So, you know, I don't know if that shit works, but it amused me at the least. It made me feel like I was doing some some James Bond shit.",yes
"0:21:11 Shaan: All right. Last one, inspire hope. This is where you go back to him and say, look, we got other options, but we want you. Can you make that happen? Can you get your deal? Can you get your offer a little stronger here, here and here? And it's time sensitive. Look like we have this other offer on the table. They're not going",no
0:21:24 Shaan: to sit around and wait.,no
0:21:25 Shaan: So if you can get us something we can we would like to work with you.,no
"0:21:28 Shaan: We think you are the best fit. But obviously, you know, burden in hand is a really good offer. And, you know, I don't want to blow it for my team by sitting here hoping you guys come around. You need to use the leverage from one deal to get a better deal. And then you sell entirely. So You need to have your due diligence stuff ready. You need to make sure that the closing terms are clean. You need to get a good lawyer and a good accountant. And don't burn bridges, because deals fall through and you may need to go back. So make sure you communicate properly, even when you say no to people, and do everything with sort of integrity and grace, because many times deals have fallen through, we need to go back.",no
"0:22:04 Shaan: When we sold to Milk Road, it was somebody we had rejected last minute, but we didn't burn the bridge and they didn't burn",yes
"0:22:11 Shaan: the bridge. And we came back later and we said, hey, still interested? And They sure were. And there you go. The advice I got here, my deal dealer was this is when you need to sprint the hardest. So normally an entrepreneur gets",yes
"0:22:22 Shaan: a term sheet. It's like they want to relax. Finally. Look at this, the big number. I'm going to be rich. This is awesome. And they take a moment to relax. You can't relax here. This is where you sprint the hardest to close. You cancel everything else.",no
"0:22:36 Shaan: You just spend all day following up with lawyers, data room, your accountant, making sure that all your ducks are in a row, solving any problems along the way.",no
"0:22:46 Shaan: Lastly, celebrate. Make sure you celebrate very often.",no
0:22:50 Shaan: The whole process is so stressful that the main feeling is just relief.,no
"0:22:53 Shaan: I think that's common, but you want to let that relief subside and",no
"0:22:56 Shaan: then have the joy and the pride that you did something kind of amazing. Okay, remember some tips here. The great advice I got birds fly, fish, swim, and deals fall through. That's what they do. Just remember deals fall through. That is completely normal for them. You can't get emotionally too high, too low. The second deal momentum is everything.",no
"0:23:15 Shaan: If you have a conversation going,",no
0:23:16 Shaan: the speed with which you follow up and you,no
"0:23:18 Shaan: get them the materials and you, you move forward is everything. Momentum is everything when it comes to dealmaking. And last thing, one choice is no choice. If you only have one person that could buy you one company, that's going to buy you, you have essentially zero people",no
0:23:32 Shaan: that will buy you have zero leverage.,no
"0:23:33 Shaan: So you need to have multiple choices. One choice is no choice. All right, that's it. That's the masterclass.",no
0:23:39 Shaan: Let me know what you thought about that one. Drop comments on YouTube. So that's where I read them. So go,no
"0:23:44 Shaan: to go to YouTube. My first million hit the thumbs up. If you like this, subscribe to the channel. We're over 200, 000 subscribers now, that's amazing. If you guys like these, I'll do more of these.",no
"0:23:52 Shaan: They're not easy to do these masterclasses, right? Like it ain't easy to drop these kinds of bombs, but if you guys like it, I will make an effort and I will try to do more of these until I'm all out of knowledge, and then I'll stop and just go retire.",no

0:01:09 Shaan: What's up? We got Jack here. Jack Smith.,no
"0:01:45 Shaan: That's right. And you did it all wrong. Yeah. So, okay, we talked about it on the podcast. It takes is like a supposed to be like a digital masquerade party. So you're supposed to show up, you pick a new name, that's your mask. Nobody knows who you really are. And then you come in and it's kind of like it's a private group, but nobody has a real name. So you can kind of the idea is you speak more freely. But of course, Sam first joins the thing like two weeks late, then he's like, what's Apex as if we didn't talk about it?",yes
"0:02:18 Shaan: so he joins and then he uses his real name And then he goes on it says hey guys, it's Sam What's up? I'd love to hear your feedback like it's a fucking Facebook group Which we already also have the",no

Like, I love knowing what's actually in people's minds, even if it is like, it's some random point or it's really mean. It's like, that's the stuff you never hear. Like, there's positive, there's compliments, there's constructive feedback. And then there's just the shit people really think about you. So this is the way to see the shit people really think about you.",no
"0:03:24 Shaan: You did it once. I think it's because you have all these like random skills slash hobbies. And so each time it's a different one, it'll be like, I can dunk, I can skateboard, I can ride a pogo stick. I used to run track, like you always have like a thing like that. So that's what they were making fun of.",yes
"0:03:44 Shaan: Yeah, I thought that was hilarious.",no
"0:03:56 Shaan: I think this app can take off. So it's an app that I discovered called Apex that it lets you host this, these types of private masquerades, these private groups. I got invited into one that was super interesting. So then when I was telling that story, I was like, oh, we'll, we'll make one for this, this group for listeners and we'll put the link in there. And then it got hundreds of requests. And I was like, dude, I'm not going to go through and approve all these. Because to get in the door, you have to link your like, I made it where you have to show social ID like at the beginning. And then after that, you can't see who's who. But like at the beginning, you could just make sure that they're not like bots or spam. The developer who made the app, he went, I was like, can you just auto accept all these people? And he just went and did that. So now there's like a few hundred people in the group.",yes
"0:04:51 Shaan: I believe that. So first, I'm pretty sure in my first group that I got invited to, I'm pretty sure Balaji is in there. You can kind of tell when people talk because they say some ideas that really, you know, and he's such an original thinker that like, if he's saying it's either somebody just parroting what he says or Tim. And I know he's friends with some of the people who started the group. So I think that is him. But he's been saying this for a while. And actually, just yesterday, I went back and I watched maybe five different YouTube talks of his because I went for a hike and I just put his YouTube talks on from back in 2013. He has two like big ideas. So one of them is what you're talking about, which is separating, you know, your real identity from your work identity and your public social media identity. So he basically thinks the way that we treat like our social security number, that's how we're going to treat our real name and face. It's not going to be something you give out unless you have to. And you use that to like create accounts and those accounts have their own usernames. So when you go to work, You're not going to be Jack Smith with your face. You're going to be, maybe you're called like, you know, growth guy 33 and your growth guy, 33, you work, you know, for some company. And when you show up on zoom calls, you're not going to show your face. You're going to show like an avatar or something so that you can basically have a separate identity. And he called this five, six years ago because he's like, he's like social media is turning into a mob and people are gonna start getting, he didn't say the word canceled, but he was like describing cancel culture. He's like, you can just say something on Twitter and you could lose your job for it. That was your personal opinion and your free time on your social media. And that's affecting your career. He's like, so these things are all going to split. Your communications name is going to be one, your work identity is going to be another. And then your real thing is going to be like your social security number.",yes
0:06:42 Shaan: And then leaked. Yeah.,no
"0:07:00 Shaan: Yes, I have people like that, that I met on Twitter, then I went to Twitter DMs, and then I went to like iMessage or Signal. And you know, they've called me before and like, you know, I've hung out with them either zero times or one time in my whole life, which is weird, by the way, right? It's a weird thing.",yes
"0:08:04 Shaan: Do you guys think this is because he's a futurist, right? So first of all, everything he says, I think of him like somebody who literally is a time traveler, like he comes back in time and he says something to me and I'm like, okay, even if I don't understand this, this is just what the future is. I just don't know if it's five years, 10 years, 25 years from now.",no
"0:08:32 Shaan: Sure, sure. I'm not saying he's right all the time. That's not what I mean to say. I mean, the things he says, they sound so foreign to today because he focuses on the future and like kind of like the deep future and the radical future, not like small incremental changes, but like what would the big shifts be? And there's one school of thought, which is like, you're never wrong, you're just early. For a lot of these predictions, like your guy who wrote this book in 1981, right? Like you're wrong until you're right for a lot of these big ideas. Like the idea of Bitcoin, this universal currency, that's actually been around for a while, and then it was wrong until it starts to become right.",no
"0:09:09 Shaan: I haven't read it, but yeah, I'm familiar with it.",no
0:09:38 Shaan: Did I tell you about the conversation I had with one of the early developers of the Silk Road?,yes
0:09:43 Shaan: No. What? He listens,no
"0:09:45 Shaan: out and he's, uh, he's like, hey, this is who I am, confirmed his identity. And he's like, I was one of these people. If you Google my username, you'll see all these articles about me. He's like, I just, you know. And so I can't say too much, but I talked to this guy for a while, fascinating guy. I can't say too much, but basically, he was a fan of the podcast. Okay, so I'll tell you something crazy. And I got to ask him what I can say. We don't have to just delete this.",yes
"0:10:17 Shaan: If we cut it out, just know if you're coming back in right now in the recording, we just talked about some crazy shit that we had to cut out.",yes
"0:11:55 Shaan: magical money printers. Yeah, Jack, what do you think?",no
0:16:33 Shaan: As a figure of speech or you were literally taking a shit?,no
"0:18:06 Shaan: There's a tweet I put out the other day that's like one of these fortune cookie tweets, but I think it's true, which is if you, if you want to know how something works, you ask experts. If you want to know how something is going to work, you ask a beginner, basically. So the idea is that experts can describe how things already work, but they're not great at describing how things could work or should work in the future. And that's where the beginner's mind really helps.",no
"0:19:56 Shaan: And you guys had mobile apps, which was new and going to be huge.",yes
0:20:59 Shaan: Value.,no
0:22:58 Shaan: What's the next mobile apps?,no
"0:23:45 Shaan: Well, there's news, right? So they just raised money at a billion dollar valuation, probably less than a year since launching their test flight. So that's kind of amazing. Sam, do you still think it's stupid or you have revised your opinion?",no
"0:23:59 Shaan: No, no. For you. To you. Do you like it now or do you not use it?",no
"0:24:03 Shaan: Jack, do you like it?",no
"0:24:08 Shaan: I knew people would like it because we had built Blab and Blab was so similar to Clubhouse. And there's differences, right? Like, you know, There was no pandemic happening during Blab where people needed to connect. Kind of like the whole world. You know, my mom does Zoom calls with the family now. Right. Like, so everybody searched for some digital solution to talk to other people. So that was different. We were also, you know, video and Clados' only audio. And that's, you know, could be a difference. We saw very similar things, which is that like some group of people, the Norendos of the world, they will make friends with a whole bunch of like semi strangers who they start to get along with on the platform. And then a bunch of inside jokes emerge. And then this habit forms where they start every night, 8pm, they just want to see what's going on. They get the notification that four people are talking and then they join in and, oh shit, four hours have flown by, six hours have flown by and I'm still on Clubhouse. And like, wow, this is kind of addictive. And I still don't think this is going to work. In fact, I was debating a friend. I have a friend who's an investor in a bunch of social companies that were like the big winners, right? Like the, I can't say what companies will give him away, but like, you know, many of the multi-billion dollar social networks. And I said, you know, are you a believer? And He said, I said, would you invest at this valuation? Because I think investing in a billion dollar valuation, I wouldn't do it right now. The first round was at a hundred million dollar valuation. I also wouldn't have done that. He said, yeah, I would. It's a, you know, asymmetric bet, meaning small chance of success, but the success would be so huge. It's still the right bet to take. And I was like, yeah, but you can kind of talk yourself into that for like any social product, right? Sure, if the social product, if Apex works, it's going to be massive. But if it doesn't, it's, you know, you just lose your size of your bet. And he's like, yeah, but like this has a bunch of things that might actually work. And I was like, cool, I think I'm just too jaded. So my own failure with Blab has made me think that this can't work. And I think that's kind of a dangerous position to take.",yes
"0:25:56 Shaan: Yeah, we hit 4 million, right? We had four and a half million when we shut it down. Those were all active. That was like total users within, and it was, I think, 16 months after we started. So you just had",yes
"0:26:06 Shaan: million users. And I think on a monthly basis, we had 400, 000 active. That's why we knew this is not going to work because 10% of your user base being active every month is too low. And we also knew that like, the problem with some of these apps is, it would be one thing if everyone was using Clubhouse with their friends, right? If we were using Clubhouse to shoot the shit, because oh, Sam's in Austin and Jack's in somewhere else and Sean's in California, You know, we need the clubhouse to bring us together. That will grow like crazy because everybody will invite their friends or their family to the app. The app will grow like crazy and it'll be super sticky. But apps like clubhouse and what Blab did was the fun was meeting a whole bunch of new people that you were hanging out with. Now The problem with that is that doesn't scale because you're not bringing your friends to the network. You're coming to the network to make friends. That's why Narendra likes it. He made a bunch of friends. Like if you go on and see the rooms he hangs out with, I bet you those are people he's never met in real life. Like they're cool people. They're people who has things in common with, but they were not his IRL friends. And so because of that, you don't grow virally because people aren't bringing their own friends. And then it's also not sticky for most people because most people will have the reaction you had, Sam. You go in and you're like, if you don't immediately find a live chat room that's interesting to you, and also you don't have like the time and the bandwidth because it's like, well, there's no editing, right? So it's got to be like good right away and get to like something that hooks you. Otherwise, you're going to bounce and you do that three times. You can be like, why am I opening this app? I should just open Instagram. Every time I open Instagram, the top photo on my feed is on point. It's awesome. Even if that photo was taken three days ago, but the algorithm knows this is juicy. You're going to get some dopamine hit of like pleasure or laughing or whatever from this photo. And here's the next photo, next photo. So that's the thing that those apps have that apps like Clubhouse and what killed Blab, they don't. So I would still be betting heavily against it. Now that's not a cool position to take because like who, what's the fun in rooting against a startup? Like there is no market for me to go short the startup or bet against it because everyone's like, yeah, duh, like it's hard to build the next Twitter, but like, maybe this can be it.",yes
"0:28:49 Shaan: Which it won't be, right? So this is the thing. I went to a brunch. I think you were there, Jack, actually. Those James Currier brunches that he used to throw, the NFX brunches. I went to one of them while we were working on Blab. He was one of the lead investors of Meerkat. He was one of the guys who helped Meerkat figure out what it was going to be. And I talked to him, I was like, man, we're hitting this problem, Meerkat's hitting this problem. Everybody on the outside thinks this space is so hot, but all of us on the inside are fucking panicking because we know how hard this is to get users to stick around when it's live, unpredictable content. And he was like, yeah, he's like, he drew this like diagram with his hands. He goes, think about it this way. Every network, every app that you're going to open has to be interesting. So there's like this interestingness scale. You got to be high on the interesting scale. He's like, and YouTube has this problem. Instagram has a problem. Pinterest, Facebook, everybody's trying to show you something interesting. And they have like millions and billions of photos to pick from, but they're, you know, they're going to show you something interesting. The algorithm does that. The problem with meerkat and Blab and all you guys is then you cross section that with something that's super interesting that's happening right now. And that right now problem, the evergreen problem you're talking about, it doesn't make the problem two X harder or four X harder. It makes it like two million times harder. And that's the main problem. That's the one reason that really Twitch is the only live network that has worked, unless you count live TV, which I guess is a different sort of outlier with like highly premium produced content. And so Twitch is the only one where it's users creating content live and it actually works. And one of the reasons why is because when you're streaming a game, the person can kind of just come in whenever there was no beginning, middle and end of a conversation. You just hop in, they're playing the game and you're going to leave whenever you want. And the streamer stays live for like eight hours straight. So the interesting people are online for eight hours a day, because playing a game is easy. You can actually do it for eight hours, whereas talking on Clubhouse for eight hours would be impossible to be interesting for eight hours. And so that's the problem with apps like Clubhouse. And that's why like the fundamentals to me don't make sense. I think the valuation and all this stuff is for people who don't really understand what's happening and how hard this type of network is to make.",yes
"0:31:21 Shaan: YouTube was already working. YouTube was already massive. It just might have died because of the, you know, all the copyright lawsuits that they were getting hit with.",no
"0:31:35 Shaan: Instagram was also sticky. And again, the fundamentals of Instagram, you could see why that would work. You knew that people viewing photos on a feed, that works. Oh, these guys have done it well on mobile. And they're faster than Facebook on mobile. They sort of built Facebook for mobile. And so Facebook buying them made sense. I haven't seen the data, so maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Clubhouse has some amazing retention metrics that have defied the odds of all the others of us who have tried something similar, I doubt it.",no
0:32:14 Shaan: That means if it becomes a,no
"0:32:16 Shaan: billion company, you only 10 extra money. And I think that the risk reward there is so far off that, you know, to me, this is an example of investors, you know, just wanting to be the one who gets the hot girl at the dance. You know, like Clubhouse is the name everybody knows, and you can sort of talk yourself into it. Like becoming a $10 billion company is no fucking joke. You know, like I think Snapchat when they went public were what, 10 or 20, like max? And that was 10 years in. Not to shit on him because he seems like",no
"0:33:00 Shaan: Yeah. And I think he was also in Secret, which was like probably the last big social app to do this was Secret, where Secret comes out, it's in a small number of people's hands, it's super interesting. And the tech guys love it. And, you know, raised at $100 million valuation, Boom, just like Clubhouse did. It didn't get to that next one at the billion. Yik Yak did, but Secret didn't. And then both of those died because of kind of fundamental problems which were around, you know, like, you know, fully anonymous networks.",yes
"0:34:17 Shaan: No, no. So I'm not like, I don't hate it. I am probably too scarred by it. So like I'm scarred by it to the point where I would never go try to build another social app. I think it's like just in terms of the risk reward ratio, I guess there's just so many better ways for me to have success than to try to be the genius who catches lightning in a bottle. You know, the lottery ticket winner who really comes up with the next Snapchat, the next Instagram, the next Pinterest, whatever, right? Like I would love it, but damn, that's hard. And there's just so many other ways where I have a much higher chance of success. So I wouldn't do it again. But I love thinking about it. I love talking about it. I love using these apps. I try all of them, right? Like I enjoy them and actually enjoy using Clubhouse sometimes. I actually thought that the real value of Clubhouse was for anybody who was on it during the first like three to five months, you could meet every single interesting person in tech or even like Hollywood. Like I had conversations with NBA players on there. I had conversations with, you know, Scooter Braun. I had conversations with, you know, from kind of like Justin Bieber's manager. All the tech people were on there. The VCs, again, I tweeted this yesterday. You can't get a meeting with these guys. If you try to schedule them, their EA will say, you know, they're booked till March. How's the third week of March for you? And then you have to fake also being busy and be like, let me check. Even though, you know, you have, you know, you don't schedule three months out. And then that guy will be on Clubhouse for three hours that night, you know, shooting the shit, doing nothing. So like it was the best way to build your network and build your kind of friend group. And what even one connection that came out of Clubhouse could really change the trajectory of your life because all the people on it early on were heavy hitters. And then now as it gets kind of like more opened up to more people because they want more users and now, you know, they send me a message that says you have 30 invites. It's like, OK, they're trying to juice growth. They're trying to try to accelerate growth. Now that value is gone. So I don't think it's that interesting anymore.",yes
0:36:18 Shaan: Explain what's going on for people who don't know.,no
0:38:13 Shaan: by order.,no
"0:39:28 Shaan: of people. It's funny, scary. Yeah, it's funny, scary. I actually had a funny story. So three days ago, I'm in this like chat group and I posted I said, hey, who's got hot stock tipped for me? I feel like gambling. And I told I said, I got 100k I'm going to gamble. Yeah, give me give me some give me your best recommendation. So people were just responding is there's like six, seven people in this group, they were like, you know, this because of this back because of this reason, you could just speculate on this, you know, just funny things. And Greg Eisenberg, who's been on the pod a couple times, he goes, I think GameStop still has a 20x to go. And I actually didn't know what was going on with GameStop at the time. This was, I think, the first day of the pump, like when it was like 50% or something like that. And I looked at it, I was just like, what is he talking GameStop? I just like, you know, just referencing some again, some obscure old dead thing as whatever. And so anyways, I picked one, I put an arcade into it. And then fucking GameStop has been up. I think I would have had like",yes
0:40:27 Shaan: or something crazy if I had literally just taken his like his joke recommendation to be serious. It was crazy.,yes
"0:40:40 Shaan: Yeah, it's wild how and so is there something I actually don't know. Is there something when the shorts cover their position that boosts the stock more because they had",no
"0:41:46 Shaan: I was just looking at Tesla's short position. So at one point, Tesla was the most shorted stock in the market. And then Tesla stock obviously has gone insane. And so just in the last. What is this? So this is the last. Actually, is the short position up? I think there might be a larger short position. So January of 2020, it was 25 million of short interest. And now, and at the end of the year, it was 60 million. So, so even, even with the massive run up and people certainly covering their positions, it looks like the short position is still Huge against Tesla, which is interesting. It makes sense to me",no
"0:42:43 Shaan: One more little thing. I don't know how much time you have, Jack, but are you paying attention?",no
"0:42:47 Shaan: Okay, one minute. Okay, maybe we can't do this one. All right. I'm just going to give you the short version of it. Actually, let's do this one. I'll do it. I'll do a shorter one. Are you familiar with grayscale BTC? Yeah. Grayscale. So, Jack, explain grayscale to Sam real quick.",no
"0:43:19 Shaan: So the guys who started Grayscale, I think one of them was the former co-founder of Coinbase, I believe.",no
"0:43:25 Shaan: Yeah, Barry Silbert's involved. Maybe I got it wrong. Maybe he's doing a separate one. But basically, you know, the Winklevoss and others have been trying to start a Bitcoin ETF to make it easier for a normal investor to go into E-Trade and buy into Bitcoin without having to figure out how to hold it or figuring out how to start an account on Coinbase or whatever else. And it just keeps getting rejected. And I think, Jack, last time you were on, you mentioned an idea like this. You were like, why doesn't somebody create a Bitcoin index fund? Like just do it in the Middle East, do it somewhere else that's like just not on the US, you know, on the NASDAQ.",no
"0:43:58 Shaan: Right. And so Grayscale, I mean, it's been so crazy successful. So basically, this thing has grown like crazy. So they now have 24 billion in assets under management as like a pretty new thing. They are buying some sick amount of Bitcoin. I think they hold over 3% of all Bitcoin now. And the crazy thing is everybody who's buying Bitcoin from there is buying it at a premium because they have not only like a management fee of 2%, they literally they just trade at a higher price than their underlying Bitcoin holdings. So you're paying a premium for that convenience. And I just think this is like one of the like, these guys are going to make the guys in charge of this, you know, probably gonna make over a billion dollars doing one of the simplest, simplest in terms of like, they didn't build a product. They didn't invent Bitcoin.",no
"0:44:45 Shaan: they paid some lawyers basically to say, hey, could we do this? And yeah, let's go ahead and list this and see what happens on, you know, on the OTC. And I just think it's it's insane that it's trading. I don't know what the premium is. I believe it's",no
"0:45:01 Shaan: Thanks for coming, Jack.",no
"0:45:05 Shaan: Okay. I'm also supposed to jump in. Yeah, let's do it.",no
"0:45:16 Shaan: By people in the know, it's not, it's not the best, but it is definitely tier one,",no
0:45:38 Shaan: I love this idea that they're doing.,no
"0:45:47 Shaan: So I don't think they have a media business today. I think they put out content just like most VCs do. They have podcasts and stuff to like be thought leaders so they get better deal flow. But now they're like, no, why do we need to go to the Wall Street Journal when we want to write an opinion piece? Let's just make a media company and we will write opinions into that. And like, let's actually blow this thing up. I think this is a really smart idea. Kind of a no-lose situation. Like, they have multiple billion-dollar-plus funds. So, the media business doesn't need to be a big business for them for this to add value to them.",no
"0:46:21 Shaan: And so I think that it will, I think it will be successful, you know, financially, but at a scale that's for them, for probably pretty small, but the impact and the influence and the ability to like dictate their own terms and not be beholden to the media and having to like play nice with journalists and do all this stuff. They're like, no, we'll just be the journalists. Why not? And this has already been a trend, right? Like Mark Andreessen on Twitter will get millions of impressions. But I think it's smart of them to go straight into the media business and compete. And I love how the media people are all so upset about this.",no
"0:47:08 Shaan: By the way, I think this is a general trend for VC, which is that, this is not exactly the case for Andreessen, but it's a good example. VC is gonna shift, I think, to businesses that startups need that happen to invest that have basically they have a venture arm. So I'll give you an example. I've ever heard of Tusk Ventures. No. So this guy, I think, is it Bradley Tusk? He's like a kind of a big dog in the like kind of like lobbying world, kind of like the legal, political world. So he was an early investor in Uber, Airbnb, and a handful of other really big winners because he was the guy who was helping them go into cities, lobby with the cities, and get their kind of like new product, you know, like Airbnb or Uber was a new idea, get it through with governments. And so he was a service provider that they would normally pay for for their startup. And he was like, yeah, but I'm a venture investor. So if you want me to work with you on this, let me invest. And so this guy's made a killing on Airbnb and Uber and these other guys. And I think the same thing is going to happen for lawyers. Like every startup today goes to one group of people for investment and another group of people for legal services. Somebody, and you know, maybe it's me, somebody's going to go buy a law firm and be like, hey, here's what we're doing. We're cutting prices down to the bare minimum. We're going to be ultra client friendly, and we're going to just invest off. We're going to we're going to raise a fund out of this legal, you know, this law firm to invest in all the companies that we work with that that we do this for.",no
"0:48:35 Shaan: I think that they take equity right now in some startups. Some do, they take the set of cash, they take equity.",no
"0:48:41 Shaan: Yeah, there's like a partner. The other thing that works there is like recruiting. So every startup wants to recruit engineers. So instead of being a recruiting firm that makes all your money, your business model is give me 20 percent of the first year salary. It's going to be a business model that is basically like I will do the recruiting for you, but we invest in your company. We invest and then we are your recruiter firm at cost.",no
"0:49:08 Shaan: It's different from... Oh, I'm Andreessen Hurwitz and we have some marketing people on staff to being like, no, we're a badass ad agency with a venture arm. We are a badass legal firm with a venture arm. We're a badass recruiting firm with a venture arm. I think it's a different thing. And I think founders are going to start taking that because they're going to be like, hey, I get two for one here.",no
"0:49:30 Shaan: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. MrBeastManager. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's a good example. Cool. I got to jump. So I'll see you.",no
0:00:17 Shaan: This is my management style too.,no
"0:02:36 Shaan: So you and Rob have more in common than you think. He's planning his poops and you're planning your returns in a giant spreadsheet. You have this, like Sam said, this kind of like personal wire cutter you create for yourself. Sure. Have you always done that? Or was that like, I got too much time on my hands. I'm going to come up with a new hobby, like, you know, figuring out the best of everything. Were you doing that kind of when you were 21 also?",no
"0:04:08 Shaan: I call you, uh, when I describe you to other friends, I said, I think Jack is the most interesting man in the world. And I think, uh, there's this great quote. It's like to be interesting, you need to be interested. And to me, that's the perfect description for you. You're the most interesting man in the world because you're interested in the most things at the most depth, you know, in the highest variety. And so I've talked to you about, you know, five different things and you've gone down a rabbit hole in each one of them. So it turns out and because of that, you always have like a really interesting point of view. What's been the best find like you're talking about this chocolate rabbit hole you went down and you're like, you know, you, you, You may come out with a different conclusion than the experts or the people who've done this for a long time What's an example where you you kind of just got you came to a different conclusion yourself?",no
"0:08:17 Shaan: They're 9 billion. Now they were 20 billion at its peak of something like 2025 billion at its peak. What do you think they did? Why did they have kind of a, let's call it 10 to 20 X bigger outcome. If they started a year later, when you look back, what did you learn from that?",no
"0:08:35 Shaan: besides Furcon being a beast,",no
0:11:04 Shaan: That's amazing.,no
0:14:59 Shaan: Robert Leonard,no
0:19:21 Shaan: This is my management style too.,no
"0:20:54 Shaan: That's awesome. You put a couple of things on the sheet that I want to do. Um, you said business opportunities, So you're not, it sounds like you're not doing, you've been able to resist the temptation to start another business, even though you're good at business and you see lots of opportunities. So, share with us a couple of these like random ideas that you have on this list.",no
"0:24:54 Shaan: So this is, oh my God, this is the business model that, um, the think and grow rich guy does and Dave Ramsey I've come to realize. So what they did is I know somebody who reached out to uh he got into think and grow rich Robert Kiyosaki's like you know book plus",no
"0:25:22 Shaan: Yeah, sorry. That's what I meant. Rich dad, poor dad. Oh, did I say the other one? Yeah, yeah, yeah.",no
"0:25:26 Shaan: So he reaches out to the rich dad, poor dad guy who I think is that Kiyosaki guy and he's basically that like he's got a philosophy. He's like, look, this is the way to get rich and it makes sense. And you're like, cool, I want to do it. He's like, awesome. Reach out to one of our, uh, you know, reach out to our headquarters and we'll do a call and We'll get to know you and we'll tell you what we think you should do. And it's just a layer reselling tax strategy. And so what he did was he paid 20 K to these guys to get a connection to a tax strategy, lawyer, a tax strategist and lawyer who then did, Uh, you know, saves him a bunch of money. He actually saved him like 80 K or something like that. So he's like, oh yeah, that was a great deal. I put in 20, got 80. Then he introduced me to the tax guy and the tax guy is like, cool. Yeah, for all this, it'll be six K. And I was like, oh, but like I told my brother, I was like, you know, you, you paid 20, I paid six, what, what do you mean? And he was like, well, yeah, like that. I was like, where did the other, you know, where were they all the other money goes like, oh, that goes to like their central agency, like that filters the deals. They don't just take a cut. It's not like we get a",yes
"0:26:28 Shaan: referral fee. They mark up the whole service by three X and keep 66% of the three X markup in order to do this. And then Dave Ramsey does the same thing. So I was like, you see Dave Ramsey, right? Like, you know, America's, you know, favorite uncle or whatever. And He's doing this call-in show. He does all this stuff. And I was like, how much, and we had done this feature on him on pod. That blew my mind. Sam, you knew a little bit about this, but he has like a huge campus of like his office is like a it's in Tennessee. He's got like, you know, multiple buildings, hundreds of people on staff. And I was like, dude, how big is this guy's podcast that he could pay for that? That sounds a little outrageous. Like what's going on here. And it's basically the podcast, the books, all of that is just lead gen for people to come to him. And if you go to his website, it'll say, what do you, what do you need? You want insurance? You want a mortgage? You want to learn how to save money? You want tax help? Talk to people with the Ramsey shield. And basically what he does is he goes and finds local people in your market. He, they have to pay to apply. So they pay some number, some amount of money and, uh, like, you know, a couple of thousand dollars to get certified and when they're certified, so he makes money off them, but then for them, it's a no brainer because they're going to get leads from his giant top of funnel. Like his website, if you go to like, uh, whatever the traffic, you know, analysis, um, on similar web, it says it gets 10 million visits a month on his website, so he's getting a huge amount of traffic that he just funnels down to these providers And he basically gets his cut and they, and these advisors all have the shields. Like what does the shield means? Like our team has vetted them. I say, you vetted what? You don't know if these guys are, you know, what are you actually doing out here? And I'm pretty sure this entire business is making like 300 million a year. Um, and this is a, or more a combination of basically his, like the, the Ramsey trusted advisors. And it's basically like, they follow the Ramsey rules. Um, and it's like, what are the Ramsey rules? It's like, oh, you know, there's parts of his philosophy that they follow. And, um, and so they can, they can either pay for the leads or they pay for the certification and just off this lead gen, he's just generating just like tons and tons of cash. And then on top of that, he's got his, like his university And then he's got his media ad stuff. So the combination of all those is sort of like. Uh, 300 million plus a year empire, which is pretty insane. And it's doing exactly what you described, Jack. It's a, it's a layer that I call it a router business. It's going to route you to the service you want. Yeah. And you know, I'm the router because I'm the trusted source. And if I do actually do a good job of curating or hand selecting and people get a good outcome from it, then this can be a sustainable business. And so, yeah, I think you're absolutely right on that.",yes
0:29:13 Shaan: Yeah. What's this RTFM? What does that mean?,no
"0:33:23 Shaan: I think case text has been around for like 10 years though. So whatever they were doing before, uh, you know, they, they were around. Uh, so like, I think They have like on the website, right there right now it says 10, 000 law firms use them. So you know, it's not literally just a prompts, but I get, I get your point and definitely they got the, uh, the AI premium on the exit here because, uh, you know, became immediately strategic and urgent for, for like this next And I'm totally with you about the, the, you know, you can become an expert in mid journey and chat GPT in like nine days, nine days of like trying to do shit. And then basically figuring out how that applies to certain vertical or job is, uh, is definitely like a thing that, that can exist and should exist. I had the same thing. I was trying to use it in my business, my e-com business. And I was like, how do I do this? And I just reached out to the guy at runway. And I was like, Hey, I'm trying to take an image and make a very similar image. And I was like, it's not like I can't do text to image. I can't describe this image. I have an image. I want another one like it and I want actually 50 variations of it. Can you do that? He's like, oh yeah, we have image to image. Just go over here. I was like, oh, thank you. Like this would have, I didn't know even which tool to use. I wouldn't have known what it's called. I wouldn't have known how to do it. And then, oh, I did it, but there's one problem. He's like, oh, just change the setting, blah, blah, blah. And then it just fixed it. I was like, wow, that's, uh, that's amazing. It saved me so much time. And you, you really do have to play with these things and most people don't have the time or the patience To go play with these things to figure out how they actually work",yes
"0:36:23 Shaan: Here's what he said. Exactly. It's a blog post called how to win at the sport of business. He goes every night. I would take home a different software manual and I would read it. Of course, the reading was captivating. I'm reading Peachtree Accounting, WordStar, Harvard Graphics, Lotus, APAC. Every night, I would read some after getting home, no matter how late it was. It turns out, not a lot of people ever bother to RTFM, read the freaking manual. And so it turned, so people really started thinking that I knew my stuff and that's all I was doing.",yes
"0:37:02 Shaan: You have a few others that I got to ask you about. Okay. So you wrote on this little cheat sheet, you wrote, uh, hack, uh, you know, non-obvious barriers to entry for business. And then you said hacking the iPhone to record screen. Uh, what are you talking about here? Non-obvious barriers, barriers to entry for business. Sure.",no
"0:43:05 Shaan: I love that. I love that. You also have a couple on here. You said, why I believe in the law of attraction and practice applications. This is interesting to me because I think There's like people who believe in the law of attraction and they also, you know, believe in horoscopes and crystals and other stuff too probably. And then there's people who are, you know, hyper logical, rational problem solver types that typically don't believe in something like the law of attraction. I would have pegged you as more of the practical, uh, logical problem solver type, but you're saying you believe in this. So tell me why you believe in this and what do you mean by practical applications?",no
0:53:07 Shaan: What was the dumb trade?,no
"0:53:15 Shaan: You're like, $250k is not a lot",no
"0:53:17 Shaan: of money in San Francisco for food, rent, and my day trading business.",yes
"0:53:54 Shaan: way you described it, uh, I've heard described differently. So Tony Robbins did this, uh, this is a video on YouTube of him talking about this, where he says like, you know, you've ever heard of the phrase like a vicious cycle. And, you know, vicious cycle is kind of like what you described your friend was initially doing, which is he draws these three circles. He says, first one's belief. Second one's action. Third is results. He goes, like, what do you do when you like, let's say you're supposed to do something, but you don't really think it's going to work. It doesn't matter what it is like, you know, you're looking for the salt and you know, your girlfriend says it's in the cabinet, but you already look there. You don't think it's there. So you kind of you go, you don't really rummage around too much because you don't believe it's there. So basically, low belief typically creates low or weak action. And lower weak action almost always creates bad results. And then the story we tell ourselves is, see, I knew it. I knew it wouldn't work. And then it just reinforces the low belief. And that's the vicious cycle that happens for people. You know, it could be, I don't really believe that I'm going to stick to this diet. And so therefore, I'm not really that hardcore about it. I start to slip and then my results say, no, you never stick to what you say. And then you reinforce a low belief. It can be business, it can be personal, it can be whatever. And then there's the exact opposite, which is the virtuous cycle. The virtuous cycle is massive belief, this is going to work. What happens when you believe something's really going to work? You wake up before the alarm clock, you get out of bed, you start doing it immediately, you can't wait and you take massive action. What happens when you take massive action for a while, you start to get good results or massive results, when you get massive results and reinforces the belief, see, I knew this shit was going to work. And so that, and there's basically the, that's the difference between winners and losers is which side of that cycle do you go down? And like the, the core thing is there's some people who just wait for a result to happen to, to inform their belief. And what, what that basically means is I'm going to sort of wait to hope to get lucky and then I'll start to believe. And I think anybody who's in the kind of entrepreneurial bucket, the prereq for any result is the belief. And you have to have that sort of massive conviction or massive belief in yourself and in what you're doing. And that part is the law of attraction part. That's the part where it's faith. It hasn't happened yet. You believe it will happen. And because you believe it will happen, you're right. It's not like love, not like the secret where they're just like, close your eyes and you say, I'm not, you know, there are no weeds in the back or there are no weeds in the backyard. You look, oh, there's still weeds in the backyard. Well, you didn't take any action. You didn't go and get rid of the weeds is, is, you know, the action is, is a, is a requirement to actually do this. You, you also mentioned one other thing on that, which said you have to feel it versus just say it.",no
"0:56:29 Shaan: a difference there? Cause I, when I talk to people who, who kind of really believe in this, uh, they overemphasize this feeling, feeling it part versus just saying it or, uh, or try to believe it in your head.",no
"0:57:48 Shaan: Yeah, I do the same thing. I also think that- Who do you become? I have this persona that I created.",no
"0:58:01 Shaan: Again, this is another one that came out of tony robbins. He he goes, um, he goes We all have we all have a version of our personality like, you know, raise your hand if you've ever been Um super kind to others. Yeah. Yeah, everybody raise their hand Raise your hand If you ever made selfish choices and been a selfish asshole, everybody raises their hands We all have all these features of our personalities. Like the question is who's driving the car right now And he's like, you know people think that they come to this this weekend workshop and I'm gonna oh Tony Robbins, he changed your life In fact when you go home people sort of mock you like oh, so what happened? You're a whole new guy now. And he's like, you know, obviously you don't, um, you know, you don't. Become a whole new person after 35 years in one weekend. Um, but he's like, you know, one thing we will do is he's like, I'm gonna take the most bad-ass version of you And that's who gets to drive this weekend. And if you, if it's only for this weekend, you decide after this weekend, I don't want that person to be the one who's making decisions from now on. All right, fine. Fair, fair play. But for these next two days, that's who's in charge. We all have a version of ourself. That is the more badass version of ourselves. The one that that does believe it's going to happen. That one that one that is decisive versus indecisive. All these traits is like, and what do you call it? He's like, what do you call when you, um, I forgot what he says. Like, he's like, we're going to make that, that, uh, he's like, we're going to make that personality, our bitch. And he's like, what do you, what do you do when you train a dog? You give it a name and you train it to come when you call it. And he's like, so you're going to give it a name. You're going to figure out how you're going to be able to adopt that state when you want to be in that state. He's like, that takes practice reps and we're going to get a bunch of reps at it this weekend. And you sort of, you have to figure out, all right, what is the version of me that does have those traits that does walk that way, that does make those decisions. And then I can you call it on command or you only going to do it when you feel good or you only going to do it when the weather's nice. Like, no, no, no. You want to be able to have that on demand when you want it. He says the same thing. Like, I think his real name is not Tony Robbins either. It's like, his original name was like Anthony. He's got some other last name. He's like, people see me now and they're seeing me on stage and all this stuff. They think, oh man, Tony, you're amazing. You're just special. And he's like, no, I was Anthony, blah, blah, blah. I was broke. I was fat. I was all these things. He's like, I created this Tony Robbins motherfucker. I created him. And I was just like, I like that part of the thing that he was talking about. Cause it's, I think more empowering If you feel like, oh, you just are the way you are and that's it, you're a fixed quantity and it was, you know, it's based on your genetics, it's based on your childhood, things you didn't have control of versus this idea that, oh, I actually have multiple versions of my personality. There's some that I would want to be in charge more often than others. And I can craft that I can create that version of me that I want. That's a different mindset. Some people don't believe it. Some people are like really married to their kind of like their upbringing and their past traumas and their DNA. That's not that's not how I look at the world, at least.",no

"1:07:25 Shaan: Let's go through some of the things you did on the parenting side, Jack. So the naming thing, Sam talked about it. Yeah. Let's do that. Let's finish that one. So how'd you come up with that idea? Do you think it was a good idea? And eventually, how did you actually end up naming her besides baby?",no
1:08:16 Shaan: After you go through this traumatic experience.,yes

1:13:35 Shaan: Do you publish your research?,no
1:14:02 Shaan: and you're underscore Jack Smith. That's your thing Let's talk about some of the other crazy things you're doing. So you have a guy Watching your baby on baby camera and Pakistan or something like that. What's going on? So you what are you doing with this baby sleep monitor thing?,no

"1:17:22 Shaan: baby's like his Twitch stream. So, um, what about some of these other things? So you said, uh, I don't think that universities will exist in 20 years and don't plan to send my daughter to school, let alone college. Okay. A bunch there say more.",no
"1:24:28 Shaan: So I love this. Um, my sister actually runs a school like this called nature kids. They basically just outside all day, just walk around, they go on trails. If they find something, they like learn about it. And if they want to go climb trees, they climb trees, whatever. And it's basically has to two things. One, so she has a traditional school and she has this nature school and the nature school, the kids are like, by the end of the day, the traditional school kids are like dead, they have like no energy, they're like ready to go home and they kind of like want to just watch YouTube and whatever. And the nature kids, kids, even though they've been out walking around all day outside, they have like way more energy, which is like kind of counterintuitive. That's the first thing I noticed. Um, the second thing is, uh, yeah, like they know a bunch of things that are interesting to them versus like in school. It's sort of like, you know, you're forced to learn something that's not that interesting to you and you sort of begin to associate learning with boredom, learning with sort of like, you know, being forced to do things versus on the other side, you know, with self-driven, it's great.",yes
"1:25:29 Shaan: Yeah, the pressure of that. Now, the, and I love the story you told about that guy, but my question would be, I think, I think unschooling or sort of self self-driven learning is awesome when you're driven. So what happens if your kid is not trying to like, you know, flip a house and learn through learn about pastoralities? Like, I guess like the fear I would have, and I think most people would have, is your kid doesn't really have any interest. They kind of just want to sit around and do nothing. And so now you're unschooled, but you're not really having this kind of like awesome, you know, self-driven curiosity. Do you, like, are you worried about that? Or do you think like, no, I can create that or this situation will mold a person to be more that way?",no
"1:28:29 Shaan: I've had a few times Jack where I just call Jack randomly and I just ask him about something. And uh, I think you are kind of more of a one of one, at least in my life of people who are very, uh, like, I don't know, independent minded is kind of like the best way I would put it. Like, I think you choose to lead your life how you want. I think that's aspiring. I also think that you are extremely, like Sam said, sort of curious and like, I think you're a great competitor when you need to compete in something, but you're not constantly trying to compete when unasked for. And that's a very Silicon Valley trait. People are trying to compete in times that are, what are you competing on? Why are you trying to show that you're the smartest, you're the richest, you're the most whatever, it's an annoying trait. And I think it's great that you don't have that. So, uh, I don't know. It's good to, good to talk to you as always. Do you leave us with either a book or product recommendation? One of Jack's finds that you think people should check out that you're passionate about you, something you think is awesome.",yes

I think it's like web hosting or something like that. And, um, he was describing it and Tim was like, why did you decide to do this? He goes, um, you know, sometimes I'll pick a project. I'm paraphrasing here. He's like, sometimes I'll pick a project because I think about who's my customer and do I want to are those my kind of people and he goes this is a business That lets you host your own personal website And I just realized that people who have their own personal website for no reason like just their own name.com Those are my kind of people and I was like, oh, that's really great to figure out your filter for like, what's a simple heuristic where like, not everybody you like does this, but everybody who does this, you kind of like, and I think this like, try every product to try to find the best quality of life levers. I think this might be one of those things because everybody who I've met that does this I like that person and You're you do this Nick Gray does this and it's kind of amazing",no

When somebody's got a clear and compelling vision for their life, that is like one of the most attractive traits to me. It doesn't even matter if I agree with that vision.

None of it's gonna matter if you can't do the first thing. Sam has done the first thing with Hampton. He has proven that he can create something that people actually want and he can sell it to them. So now he's thinking, now you get what I call progressive ambition. I want to do a whole video on progressive ambition. I'm going to show people. If you go back and you watch Mark Zuckerberg's early interviews, and people are like, where does this go from here? You're on eight campuses now. Where are you going to open this up to everybody, high schoolers, everything?",no
"0:05:06 Shaan: He's like, our goal is to get to you know all the major colleges I'm not sure everyone keeps saying why you know expand expand expand some things are cooler when you don't expand and I don't think what do we have to open up to everybody? I'm not sure. I mean, something's really we could build something really, really useful for college students. Maybe we should just do that. And then now the guys like created higher balloons that give Internet to farmers in India so that they can use Facebook, right? It's like he got progressively more ambitious as he went along. And that which",no
0:05:52 Shaan: They got to create a bit more tan. We're taming it up right now. Hold on. We got to give more people the internet so they could use our app.,no
"0:06:03 Shaan: common for different companies. You can go back. I'm a forensic. I'm a, I'm an archeologist. I go back into the, to go study the early origins of these companies. And you find this very, very commonly that. They start with a sort of humble ambition. Then as things start to work, they snowball their ambition. They become more and more ambitious as they go, realizing the opportunity is wider and bigger than they had initially planned for and that one step of success earns the right to go for the next step of success and that it is okay to ladder up because what most people do is they look at them today and they say, well, now they're trying to do a, b, c and d. So I, when I start need to also plan for a, b, c and d. And it's actually like, no, you actually just start with a, you don't actually have to do anything else of course there are exceptions there's Elon Musk saying we're gonna you know but you know even Elon for example let's take one of the most ambitious companies in the world SpaceX right what's the goal what's the mission statement It's like make the human species multi-planetary so we can survive when we were on earth or earth gets, you know Hit by an asteroid or whatever and so it's like wow What's more ambitious than creating a rock literally rocket science to create rockets that will eventually take us to live on Mars. Wow. That's like the biggest vision ever. When SpaceX started his initial vision was to do a test demonstration, sending a plant in a rocket into a certain, like a certain height. I don't remember exactly where it was to, you know, have the first living thing, you know, go out of, you know, past the moon or whatever, wherever you're trying to take it. And that's all he wanted to do, is just take a plant out there. And he's like, oh, I'll just fund this, it'll take me $20 million, but it'll inspire people towards science, and hopefully NASA will then fund real Mars missions after that. And then only, you know, along the way, he's like, you know what, screw this plant thing. I'm gonna, let's actually do it ourselves. We don't need to inspire NASA. Let's just do the whole thing ourselves. He also got progressively more ambitious.",yes
"0:08:17 Shaan: He's like, you see, every every human has a number, a phone number, and you can reach them. This is one of the most marvelous things in the world. And you need a way to reach them. It's information. He'll he'll make anything sound fancy. But actually, one of the interesting things is, Elon is also credited as like he created PayPal. He didn't actually create PayPal, you know, PayPal, the product was created by, you know, first Max Levchin and Peter Thiel. But even then when they merged with Elon's company, He had this big vision for X.com. He's like X.com is going to be everybody's full financial life. It's going to be banking. It's going to be mortgages. It's going to be loans. It's going to be sending money. It's going to be savings accounts. It's going to be all things to all people. And that was the vision for X.com when they merged. Elon was the CEO of the merged company and the plan was to create x.com. And so he had this big audacious, crazy vision, his forever plan about how he's just going to change the whole financial system. And actually the only thing that worked was going back to the basics. Let's make something that people actually want and see if we can get it to them. And it was like, oh yeah, eBay sellers would love a way for people to pay the money when they send them the like beanie babies. And so literally it was send money via email, small amounts, paying a pal was the actual use case that people wanted and needed. And it was only when they essentially booted him out and focused on that small use case, the smaller vision, did PayPal actually take off. And so, you know, sometimes you almost have the reverse, you start too audacious and actually you need it, You skip the step of finding that initial foothold. And that's what PayPal actually did.",yes
"0:10:39 Shaan: So it's hard to kind of give advice without any specifics, but I'll do it anyways. I'll be the advice guy for a second. So when I was doing my very first company, it was a stupid company. We're trying to do the, trying to make a restaurant chain, the Chipotle of sushi. And we had all these micro decisions to make, like any business does on a day to day basis, should we use this packaging or this packaging for our thing? Well, this one costs more and looks better, but this other one, you know, we would have better margins because it costs less and then there's this other one that's eco-friendly and blah, blah, blah. And so one of our mentors at Duke, she sat us down and she's like, guys, you're having the wrong conversation. And we're like, what do you mean? And She's like, it's not about packaging. So what do you mean? She's like, let me ask you this. What decision can you make upstream of this? That would make your packaging decision obvious. I was like, well, we don't really get it. She's like, you got to know what do you value? Right. Are you about ruthless efficiency and margins? Cause if so, then the choice is obvious. There's no choice, right? You choose the one with the cheap packaging with the best margins. Are you about, are you, is your number one value the quality of the customer experience? Because if it's the quality of the customer experience, you definitely can choose a cheap one, but you also won't use the eco one that's going to kind of melt. You know, this old paper straws problem. It's not actually the best product, but it is eco friendly. It's like, so if you're all about product quality, that's what you're going to, going to go all in on, that's your number one value. Then the packaging decision is obvious. Same thing with the other side. If you're all about sustainability, if that's your number one value, then the decision is obvious. She's like, you don't know which packaging to pick because you don't know what you stand for. You don't know your values. And she's like, what you want to do is figure out your values, number one. So what are the things you value more than more than other things? Because there are and you only know what you value when you're choosing amongst good options. It's obvious to value something when you have a good option and a bad option. There's no you didn't test your values there. Your values only get tested when you have multiple good options, but they're good in different ways. And that's when you need to know, which one do we value? The second thing that she said was, Jeff Bezos has this great quote where he goes, they're like, oh, you know, Amazon has been around forever and you guys have just kept growing and growing and growing. And, you know, through every innovation cycle, you know, the internet, mobile phones, whatever, Amazon has been cloud, Amazon has done great. How do you stay on top of the curve? And he goes, cause we don't look for trends. We ask ourselves the opposite question. Instead of saying, what's going to change, we say, what's not going to change. So basically he's like, we're customer obsessed. That's the number one value for them. And then he's like, number two, we ask what's not going to change. Oh, are people ever going to want less selection? No. Are they ever going to want higher prices? No. Are they ever going to want slower delivery? No. Okay, cool. So now we know that those are the never changing things. So all we got to do is figure out how to give them more selection, lower prices, and faster delivery. That's what they care about. They're never going to not care about those things. They're always going to care. And all we got to do is just continually find a way to do that. So I think that gives you a sort of long term orientation. Like for Hampton, what would you say are the never going to change things?",yes
"0:13:49 Shaan: Are people ever going to want to be around lower quality founders? No, they're always going to want that bar going up that they would look in their peer group and they're in awe. How did I get in this room? Right? I think that's going to be the first feeling you want to create is holy shit. All the other people in my group are awesome. I can't wait to talk to these people. Right? That's going to be, I think, always the number one, the quality of the other members in their group to them.",no
0:14:23 Shaan: both of those things we mentioned hurts revenue. Because if you make the,no
"0:14:27 Shaan: want to increase revenue, widen the door, baby, let them all in. Now let everybody who wants to pay the bill come in. Okay. But now you've ruined the quality of member problem. Uh, you know, the longterm people will never want this to go in that direction. You're, you're screwing that up for short term profit. Same thing on the people don't show up, you ban them. Or you also, you know, have to go ahead and remove that subscription revenue from the old Stripe account. And so you're not going to want to do that either. But it will only happen if you take this long term orientation and say, no, no, the thing we value the most is people want a product or it's high quality people that show up and care about this community about this group. And if either of those two, every decision has to be first and foremost from that point of view. Does this increase the quality of our members or decrease it? Does this increase the commitment levels or decrease it?",no
"0:15:44 Shaan: dude, love Raising Cane's. I met the founder of Raising Cane once.",yes
0:16:09 Shaan: fried or fried or obesity fried. Which one do you want?,no
"0:16:37 Shaan: Yeah, of",no
"0:17:37 Shaan: You know what I'm saying? AC, let's see what's going on over there.",no
"0:18:27 Shaan: Yeah, yeah, good. I think that's cool. I take the exact opposite point of view for the record. I do not think about building things that are going to last 50 and 100 years. I think that's really hard. And I think it's unnecessary. I want to be the thing that lasts 50 or 100 years, not an individual brand necessarily.",no
"0:18:45 Shaan: I think about it is this. It depends on how you want your career to go. Some people get really excited about building something and being a part of something and working on something for 30 years, I get more excited about taking like sort of seven year chapter arcs of my life and be like, cool, I want to have five, you know, I only get one life to live. I want to experience all the things I want to ride all the rides. And so I do a, you know, I did a tour of duty and I lived in Australia and Indonesia and all these other places. That was fun. That was where I had a great adventure. I moved to Silicon Valley in the heart of San Francisco And I tried to do the billion dollar startup thing. Now I'm doing this basically cash flowing business side of things and podcasting, creating content. I'm a content creator now. That's interesting. That's fun in a new way. I'll shift at some point, seven years from now, I'm not gonna be a content creator anymore, or I'm gonna shift the content. I'm gonna create TV shows or a standup comedy set or something.",yes
"0:19:44 Shaan: I might not even put my name on, like my name is not always going to be front and center on everything when you're content creator it is but other times it's not for me the more important thing is I'm not going to bank on people recognizing my brand in order to do something I do want to accumulate enough financial freedom and runway so that I can go pursue things that don't have to make money right away. And so, but, you know, it's all about what you, the vision for you that you have for yourself. So that's why I was talking about, Rob Dyrdek has this vision for his house. You have a vision for Hampton, what you're trying to create as this long-term, enduring thing. I have a vision for my life and my career that is chapters and episodic. And I want to have that variety and new challenge where I have to like, go become uncomfortable and try to get good at something new and learn, go learn the dark arts of a whole different industry and go become a beginner again. That's something I get excited about more so than creating one thing that's going to last a long time. Or I'm going to be a part of for a long time.",no
"0:20:37 Shaan: I mean, that's the deal on that's patented. So yeah, I have to send royalties to him for saying that right now.",no
"0:20:44 Shaan: Let's move on. Okay. I got two quick ideas for you in general. I want to say this, by the way, in this pod, I think we're going to make a shift in how we create the content. So right now, every episode is this mismatch of breaking down a business, talking about frameworks, an idea, a business idea here or there. I think what we're going to start to do is segment them better or chunk them better theme, the episodes better. So you know what you're going to get and we just go really hard at one thing. So we're going to do episodes where it's really hard on just ideas, business opportunities that we see. We're going to go really hard on certain topics like one man businesses or businesses that have very few people, but just crush it. It's going to be a lot harder for us to do the prep for that, but I think it'll make for much better episodes. So we've been talking a little bit about that. I think we should put it out there that we want to start doing that.",no
"0:22:37 Shaan: But until then, let's mismatch a little bit. I got an idea for you. Okay. If you made a grid of customers that are easy to acquire or hard to acquire on one side. And then customers that are not that valuable and super valuable on the, on the other axes. One box that interests me there is hard to acquire super valuable. And The reason why is because those companies can become very, very defensible, very, very valuable, right? Your value as a company or even as a person is just based on how easy are you to replace? You want to be irreplaceable. That's how you can actually make more money in the long term.",no
"0:23:21 Shaan: Something that sells to government. So you go get government contracts, not easy, might be boring to do long-term expensive government contracts. It might take you years to get to the point where you can get one, but when you get one, very valuable and very defensible. And so I was thinking about this because I invested in this drones company called Valanci long time ago. I've invested maybe many years ago. I don't, I have no idea how they're doing. I was a small investor. I don't even get the updates, but at the time they were doing pretty well. Uh, you know, I was like, okay, cool. This valuation is a little bit rich for where you're at, but why is it, you know, why do you think this is the right valuation? And it was like, well, they're about to get this government contract. That's a hundred million dollar a year contract. One customer will now become worth more than all their customers combined because.",yes
"0:24:08 Shaan: I think it was like a, there was a couple that they were up for. I think there were like sort of three and five year deals. And once you get one government contract, you're sort of de-risked and you've done all the clearance and all that stuff. You basically have to get your company to a spot where you could get a government contract. And once you have one, being able to get the next one becomes more likely because you're sort of in the trusted vendor circle. So I was like, oh, that's pretty valuable. I was just thinking about one the other day, you know, with this whole COVID pandemic, somebody out there has got to be selling some kind of pandemic modeling software or detection software to every government in every country of the world. And this is also have like a network effect where as soon as you're providing, you're the provider of this product to one government, it's actually something that all governments would then choose you for because, you know, the more governments you get, the more compelling your case becomes. And so I wonder who's building kind of the pallet, what Palantir did for, I think, like national security type stuff, somebody has got to be doing for biosecurity. So who is creating the pandemic monitoring, detection, modeling, awareness program that you can then go sell to every single government on earth as an indefinite ongoing contract. Hey, these things happen once every 100 years. We have the Spanish flu, we got COVID. All right. I'm just going to go. I'll be your provider because, hey, they're devastating when they happen. And I can be this for you for the next 100 years. I think that's a 100-year company that is probably quite defensive and quite valuable if you can do it.",no
0:25:48 Shaan: I sent out 5 tweets Tuesday today. Yeah. My,no
"0:26:22 Shaan: I haven't I haven't researched any of this, but I'm sure they already exist. These sort of like, you know, like because people have been worried about these sort of like viral things, but obviously they were insufficient, right? So like whatever existed, obviously sucked because we didn't detect it. We didn't have any plan for it. And we had no idea how fast the thing was spreading. Like literally the best pandemic model I saw was made as a side project by Kevin Sistrom, the founder of Instagram for fun on the side where he's like, Oh, look, I can break down by state. The are not the viral coefficient basically of this, of this virus based off of this public data I'm getting about hospitals and hospitalizations. And I can use that to kind of show which states are flattening the curve versus which states are about to go exponential. And, you know, they should really consider doing something. And it's like, somebody's got to be doing this at a... This got to be the easiest sales pitch of all time right now. That's kind of what I guess what I really mean. It's like if you're sitting at MIT or one of these places, just be like, wear a sign that says I went to MIT and then go walk into the government building, open up the fanciest like MATLAB, you know, like model you could find and be like, you need to pay for this and just see what happens. I think I feel like they can get we can get pretty far right now with this pitch of like, hey, we'll help you with the we'll help you keep track of these viruses.",no
"0:27:50 Shaan: Yeah, yeah. We did this on the pod, right?",yes
"0:28:18 Shaan: I don't know the name of it. That's really hard to remember. Now, I also don't know what came of it. But yeah, there was I remember when the California wildfires were happening. It felt like every three months, there was like a new fire. And the entire like, state of California was like covered in smoke. Yeah, I remember when that was happening. To find early detection of wildfires was like a startup idea that a bunch of people got funded for.",yes
"0:28:56 Shaan: Jack Mallers Yeah, exactly. Not the same IQ. So basically, this next idea is so celebrities are having this like deepfake crisis, crisis and opportunity. So deepfakes are getting really, really good. And celebrities now have a crisis plus opportunity. So the crisis is you've seen this fake Tom Cruise, deep fake Tom Cruise. This guy's like amazing. Looks just like Tom Cruise. And it's like a video. You know, it's this is getting really good. You're not going to be able to tell.",no
"0:29:30 Shaan: Yeah, those are awesome. By the way, we should do that. We should release our podcast and everything.",no
"0:29:49 Shaan: And so I think there's an opportunity here. So I think celebrities who get paid for their name and face and you know, oh, I got to go fly to, you know, Arizona and shoot this commercial for Gatorade right now. And it's gonna be three days, but I'm gonna get paid all this money, blah, blah, blah. That's going to change into it. It would like to use your your AI clone in their commercial. You cool with that? Yeah, you get to sit at home and collect the check. And it's like, maybe it's 50% less expensive for the brand. Maybe it's the same cost of the brand. I don't know, but celeb, you don't have to do the work anymore. That's going to be a big deal. So the more famous you get now, you're not going to have to actually do the appearance thing because you'll just send her your AI stunt double to go do it. So that's an opportunity, but there's also a risk there, which is what if somebody's just doing it without your consent? And so I think somebody is going to need to create a sort of celebrity deepfake licensing company. So it's a company that goes and says, look, we're going to create the legal entity that's going to house your name and likeness that other brands can come interact with when they want access to this. And we're also going to do the detection to find out is anybody doing the unauthorized use of your name and face somewhere and we will handle all the takedowns for you. So it's kind of like a reputation.com, but for this new deep fake thing. So you basically will go and I think you'll, you need to, it's almost like AngelList, you need to create the legal framework for how these work. You need to go sell this to every agency and say, Hey, you should, we've created one for you. You have one of these for all of your, your clients on your roster. And when a brand comes to you use this to issue the license that has the rights and controls on it, that has the digital encrypted watermark on it that has the tracking on it. And then we will also fight anybody who is trying to use it without paying you because that's going to become an issue as well. That's what I think is going to happen. I think somebody could build that company right now.",no
"0:33:00 Shaan: Yeah, yeah, exactly. So I think somebody is going to need to create a good version of that. So one option is become the troll. The other option is become the official sort of like broker of of these of the usage of these digital deepfakes. All right, so that's my second one.",no
0:33:17 Shaan: That's what we talked about. Remembering,yes
"0:33:23 Shaan: Yeah, I think it's good actually. Cause remote work is, you know, obviously all the rage and remote work is great in a bunch of different ways, But I'm of the opinion, which is remote is great. When you have things figured out, you need people who are just operational to do things. Anytime. There's a lot of needs figuring out or creativity or just your brain trust. I think works best in person. And so I told Ben the other day, I was like, man, I think we're onto something with",no
"0:33:54 Shaan: business partner, Ben. I was like, you know, he lives in Austin right now. And I was like, you gotta, I was like, you gotta move out here. And he's like, Oh, but like, you know, I live here now. And wife, kid, we have family in Texas. I was like, yeah, I know. But like you, we both believe the following, right? Every time we get together, magic happens. This can be pretty big. Like what we're doing can become pretty big. And so even like a 10 to 20% improvement on what we're doing is actually worth. Tens of millions of dollars. So it's like, you know, it could be worth it to move and California is a great place too. So it's not like I'm saying, you know, let's go to rural Ohio or something. And so he was like, okay, why don't we do this? So he moved out here for the month. So he got an Airbnb in",yes
"0:34:43 Shaan: where I'm at. And he's like, I got an Airbnb, brought his wife, kid came out here. He's just been living here for the month. And, and I also, I offered him, I was like, dude, I'll pay you dollars if you move. But I told him I go, but the number drops by 20% every quarter that you don't move. I was like, this is not like a standing offer forever. It's a burning, it's an exploding offer. I said, you should take your time. You should think about it. But you should also know every quarter that you don't move that number goes down.",yes
"0:35:18 Shaan: Yeah, no, he knows I'm not going anywhere. He knows I'm not going anywhere. That's not the that's not the I actually lived in Texas for a long time. And, you know, the other thing is like here, you know, in San Francisco, there is kind of like, for example, for a rolling fund, there's so many companies, so many other investors, so many people in the startup world, like proximity is power. You want to be near as many other people as you can that are doing the same sorts of things as you are to the extent that your lifestyle will allow it. And so, yeah, we'll see.",yes
"0:35:47 Shaan: I think I got like a 10 to 20% chance. Well, I'm coming out.",no
"0:36:08 Shaan: I don't know. I think so. But we also work a lot when he's here. So I'm sure his wife's like, dude, this is terrible. Like you work more now like, oh man, I don't want to do this. And so that might be working against us. The other thing, though, is the way we work is kind of goofy. I don't think most people do this, but, you know, for coding, they have pair programming. It's not that popular, but some people do it. And pair programming is what's the name of that agency that was in San Francisco that was like a really popular dev shop. They like went public at one point, you know, you know, the name. Yeah. Yeah. I",no
"0:36:41 Shaan: mean they popularized it at least. I don't know if they invented or popularized it, but basically it's two programmers working on one computer, you know, right? It's like the engineering two girls, one cup, basically. It's like you sit together. There's one keyboard and you would think, well, okay, you have half the efficiency, like only one guy's working, only one guy's coding, But actually you get more than double the efficiency because it keeps you completely focused and you and your partner are basically both talking things through and figuring things out on the fly. And literally me and Ben do that when he comes out here to work. We I'm like, all right, put your laptop down. Like just we buddy up side by side at this desk and we'll just work on the same thing at the same time. And like, I can't just like open Twitter and start messing around over there. He's like, what's happening? What are you doing? Can't you can't just like open new tabs, you know, as you're figuring something out, one of the guys pointing something out and you just sort of really stacking. It's like, I call it like stacking focus. It's like whatever my level of focus is, plus is a level of focus on the same thing. So that's been good. The other is the in between time. So already when we work remote, we call each other all the time, you know, probably on the phone two hours a day, three hours a day, maybe on calls, either with others or just ourselves. But what's happening now is we'll work on something for a bit. That's kind of like us being on a call together working on something and then we're like, all right, let's go get food. We'll just hop on our bikes. We'll go to this taco shop. We go get this. We go to the same taco shop every day. We get the same same meal every day.",yes
"0:38:07 Shaan: Hold hands and we skip home basically. But while we're doing it, it's sort of like the best ideas are coming out in all the in-between time. And that's the time where normally, if we'd be like, okay, bye, close Zoom, close Google Hangouts or whatever. And then I put on a podcast and he does something else. And it's the in-between time where you get the serendipitous ideas. So it's just kind of reminding me how valuable it is to work in person.",no
"0:39:07 Shaan: Yeah, what if we",no
"0:39:10 Shaan: There's definitely a part of the day every single day. That's like that. I crumple up a piece of paper. I throw it to him. He throws it back and we're playing catch talking about bullshit that like, you know, things we could do that are not like just the obvious things. But the beauty of it is as I've gotten older and I've gotten wiser and I've been doing this podcast, two things have happened. One, I hang around you and you're very good at just doing the thing every day whether it's your workout or it's whatever It's I'm just gonna do the thing and I don't want to get distracted by everything I just want to do the thing as I hang out with you as hell it helps there was also a guy who came on the podcast long time ago, one of the earliest episodes. And he does not, it's he's from peak design. They make these like camera bags. So he started his company. I'll",yes
"0:39:59 Shaan: Yeah. This was like one of the first 15 episodes, I think. And, um, he, so he makes these camera bags who knew, and they do like, I don't know at the time, like 70 million a year in revenue off of camera bags. And I was, and like clips for your DSLR camera. I was like, what the hell is that big of a market? And he had done it off of Kickstarter and he kind of inspiring guy. And as I was talking to him, I go, so what's your philosophy around business? He goes, everybody's got these like plans. They got these ideas, blah, blah, blah. He's like life and business is just the six inches in front of your face. It's just this, He just held up his hand six inches. He goes, I just look at this and I just do six inches in front of my face. It's all I'm focused on. And I just do that every day. And that stuck with me. And so we have, you can't see it, but on the wall here, I wrote six inches in front of our face on a giant like post, like a giant sticky pad thing. These things are great, by the way, you should buy these. These are giant sticky pad things where you sort of tear the paper. It's like a huge post-it note that goes on your wall.",yes
0:41:03 Shaan: I was at the one you,yes
"0:41:09 Shaan: What would session real quick? So, yeah, I have it here and it says the six inches in front of our face. And so the first thing we do every day when he comes over is we reprioritize the six inches in front of our face. It's like, what are the small no brainer steps forward that will make this like 1% better today. And we, the first three hours of the day, we don't do anything else besides knock those out. I think theoretically we could just do that for eight hours a day. I would get bored out of my mind. Also, I can kind of get eight hours of work done in three hours of focus. When I put my mind to it. And so that's what we do first. And then for the rest of the day, we think, okay, what, what else could leapfrog something forward beyond those 1% obvious improvements? So we knock out anything we could think of that's a 1% obvious improvement, the six inches in front of our face first. And so that's how we've been able to stay focused. Trey Lockerbie",no
0:42:04 Shaan: Russell Okung. Yeah.,no
0:42:15 Shaan: He was awesome. He was a former lineman. So linemen are like the biggest guys on the football field So he's,yes
0:42:19 Shaan: probably 300 pounds or something like that He's like six five.,no
"0:42:27 Shaan: yeah, and he was like a star like he won he like won a Super Bowl ring He was a Pro Bowlers. Awesome. Awesome player. I remember I think he was playing it on the Seahawks for a while That's that's kind of what I remember him. He's now on Twitter. There's a couple of these athletes like endowment can sue Russell O'Koong that are like, they're kind of like on tech Twitter somehow. Like, And so Russell's",yes
"0:42:48 Shaan: Like Matthew Delva Dover invited me to an event the other day. I was like, this is so cool that they've crossed over and they've got their athlete camp. They've also got kind of business tech interest. And by the way, the best thing about it is they come in so humble, Which is like, they don't come in with this. Well, you know who I am personality like this Saturday. So we do, I started this basketball pickup game every Saturday for founders and investors out here in the East Bay and we rent this gym and we all just play pick up for like three hours and Zaza Petulia came and he's a, he's a former player on the Warriors. And he tweeted like, oh, yeah, I'll play. And I didn't invite him to the first because I thought he was joking when he replied. And then he emailed me after the first one. Like, bro, what happened? I didn't get the invite.",yes
"0:43:31 Shaan: And I was like, no way. You actually were going to show up. And so he came this week and he was fucking awesome, dude. Like not awesome at basketball. Obviously, he's awesome at basketball compared to us.",yes
"0:43:46 Shaan: I think he's from, I think he's from Serbia. I'm not",no
"0:43:51 Shaan: Yeah. He's like seven foot. He's just, he's a beast. And so now he works for the Warriors. He does like their business side, their operate basketball operations and investing for them. And he's a super personable, super funny guy, like was totally humble. And like, you know, obviously play. Yeah, he played with us for three hours. It was amazing. I was talking so much trash to him and he was just such a good sport about it. It was amazing. So I just I gotta say I was so I've been so impressed with the way that kind of like the athletes I've seen that crossover into business and tech. They do it with God, I know so much finesse. It's really impressive.",yes
"0:44:45 Shaan: Well, yeah, for sure. I mean, if you see Zaza play in the NBA Zaza was basically like a screen center Like his number one skill was he could set a huge pick to get Steph Curry a shot But when he played against us,",yes
"0:44:57 Shaan: he's Steph Curry. He's just draining shots from all over the court You he didn't even take these shots in the NBA. You never saw him take these shots and he's just pulling up from the three point line. And he has, I was like, when's the last time you played? He's like 2019. I was like,",yes
"0:45:11 Shaan: He's like, no, no, I've shot around. He's like, I'm, you know, I'm in the basketball facility. So I shoot around, but he's like, I don't, I don't even know. Last time I like played it like a game like a kind of a competitive game So a couple things so his warm-up was like a real warm-up like he like he's talking but he's doing these like hip flexor Openers and I'm like, oh, yeah, he's like he's actually an athlete He's had to like get his body ready many many many times over and so you see like a bunch of the dudes who come in and it's like, oh, here's this VC or here's this tech founder. And we're like, I don't know, I guess, tired of touching my toes. Is that what I do to warm up? We don't even know what to do to warm up. Whereas he's like doing these like, you know, hip openers. Then the second thing is when he played, obviously his game was a lot better than you see on TV because you got to be a star in your role in the NBA and he was a star in his role as this like paint protector screen center here. He could do a lot of other things that he never got to show there The other thing is like he was like a bear so he was mostly You know just playing point guard is passing the ball mostly, you know, obviously he could post any of us up He's got a foot on all of us, you know in terms of height So he wasn't just abusing that but like we beat him the first game And then they won like six straight.",yes
"0:46:18 Shaan: Yeah, we won the first game. Yeah, they were just like, you know, whatever. We got off to a quick start. But then the they went on a six oh run or something like that. Just crushing everybody. And then when we came back out to try to beat, there was a very competitive game. And then it's like we poked the bear. It's like all of a sudden he started driving to the hoop and he started playing aggressive. It's like, oh yeah, don't forget the bear can kill you. The bear might be nice right now, but the bear will let you know that I could kill you if I wanted to. And he",yes
"0:46:51 Shaan: Don't get it twisted. This has been a three up till now. I'm just going to show you that, then I'll go back down.",no
"0:47:22 Shaan: No, I don't have it in front of",no
"0:47:33 Shaan: I think it's okungfast.com is at least where the, that's where he's hosting.",no
"0:47:59 Shaan: I think we buried the lead. So he's gone. He's going on a 40 day water only fast. He's lost a hundred pounds so far doing it. And obviously it's not just about the weight loss. It's about like sort of like the mental challenge and the mental clarity that he's getting as he's doing this, like, you know, sort of this, this really intense fast. I think he's on day",no
"0:48:40 Shaan: fourth day was the hardest, he goes, because this is where the body is transitioning into a new state. So he's like, I had headaches, fatigue. My body was transitioning to using fat as the energy source rather than the input of new carbohydrates or whatever.",yes
"0:49:11 Shaan: right? Yeah, and he's also like",no
"0:49:15 Shaan: He's also like a Bitcoin Max. He's an interesting guy. By the way, there's a guy I met named Byron Jones who retired this year. He was like one of the best cornerbacks in the, in the, in the league. And he retired, I think at 30. So he came into the league probably 21, 22 and he retired at 30, which is an early retirement. And he got paid very well probably made like, I don't know, 80 million dollars playing the NFL, but he had said something when he retired, which is that I can't run or jump anymore. And which is shocking because this is like one of the most athletic guys that was in the NFL at the time when he was playing. And I went to a dinner.",yes
0:49:52 Shaan: And now,no
"0:49:54 Shaan: Freak. My buddy Romine hosts this event called Game Time every year in LA. And it's basically a mix of investors and athletes that get together. And so I've gone the last couple of years and he hosts this dinner. And at the dinner, there was a few NFL players on the table and they all mentioned like, I forgot what they're called a tour, Torbato and not Torbato, not the steroid. It's like some shot. The NFL players get basically it's a pain tolerance shot of pain reduction shot painkiller and they were just like dude that shot it's like magic and it's a curse",yes
0:50:27 Shaan: no you feel better,no
"0:50:29 Shaan: but it doesn't cure the underlying issues It's like you he's like we would go from, you know, Sunday you play Monday. You feel bad Tuesday. You feel like man, I was in a car accident and their body feels like it was in a car accident. You're like, there's no way I'm gonna be able to practice on Thursday and play next Sunday. Like that's just like where my body's at on Tuesday versus Sunday. Seems crazy. And they said that like, they're like, man, that, you know, like the culture in the NFL is like, you got to play obviously. And so these like a lot of guys get it in the habit of taking this one shot tea something. I forgot what's called And they take the shot and they're like, it's like a miracle dude, like within an hour you're running again. And they're like, you went from not limping to like, you're just back to you. But also every time you do it, it's like taking time, you know, it shortens your career because it's just so bad for your body what you're actually doing to your body when you do that. It's not like the underlying tissues have healed in the process. It's kind of a crazy thing. So I think one cool thing about what Russell's doing is he's basically like trying to rewind the clock on when you're in alignment, they tell you to beef up. And what he's doing is doing a sort of a rapid and drastic change in his physiology in order to get his weight down so that he can live a longer, healthier life as he goes.",yes
0:52:16 Shaan: Shout out to him.,no
"0:52:19 Shaan: I like this question I got. So a guy tweeted at me. I want to get your take on it. So his name's Christian Von Uffel. Great name. The Christian says, question for you, Sean. He goes, what work seems like small boy stuff, but actually packs a punch. So we have this phrase we say on the pot all the time, no small boy stuff. And we don't even like spend a ton of time defining it because honestly, small stuff is kind of obvious. But I would say the general buckets of small boy stuff would be, you know, overly worrying about things. Small boy stuff would be thinking small rather than thinking big, thinking short term rather than thinking longterm, you know, caring too much about what other people think of you. You know, there's a whole bunch of things that you classify as small boy stuff, like complaining when things get hard or things don't go your way, complaining in general, waiting in general. These are all like small boy moves. But I thought his question was great because the magic is in things that other people think are small but actually pack a punch. And I had an answer, but I'm curious what your answer would be. I'll give you, you wanted me to go first, you wanna go first?",no
"0:53:52 Shaan: Love it. I would actually also give you credit because that would be one of my answers which is Admitting when you're wrong openly and quickly I remember hearing a story about one of the guys at Sequoia, who's awesome, like help build Sequoia into like the most successful VC brand or one of the most in a long time. Somebody asked like, what makes him great? They go, all he cares about is getting it right. He'll be in a meeting with you. He'll say his opinion and somebody else will say their opinion. And you know, most people either start to debate or it's like, we're talking past each other. It's like, I'm talking about one thing, you're talking about another and I'm the boss, so I'm going to get my way. And he's like, he's the first guy and he has this phrase. He always says, well, he'll go, okay, nope. I like your way better. Let's go with that. I'm like, nope, that's better. Like, let's go with that is a awesome small, but big thing you could do as a leader and in any company, it sets the culture that it's not about who's right. It's about getting it right. Getting to right, you know, over time. Here's what I wrote as some of my answers. I said, small things that seem like small boy stuff is actually big doing customer service yourself early on. So being on the front lines, answering customer service, emails, questions, feedback, picking up the phone, all that stuff. Manually onboarding your first 10 or 100 users. So literally yourself sitting there with them going to sit side by side with them and having them install your product or onboard onto your product and answering their questions. Seems like an unscalable small boy way of you spending your time. Actually no, it's a huge, huge thing and it'll teach you a lot about your product and your market. Sending follow ups, follow ups, following up with somebody who didn't answer you always feels like, you know, like a little low status bitch move, but it packs a big punch. Follow ups are where all the magic is. And I think there's also a big piece of follow-ups, which is a lot of people don't follow up because they don't hear back and they assume they say they're saying no, they don't like me. They hate, they hate this idea. I don't",yes
"0:55:46 Shaan: They get in their head about it. They start assuming the worst. Instead, assume the obvious. People are busy and they forget. People are busy and didn't get around to it yet. And when you follow up with that mindset, that's the sort of no small boy mindset. It's like, I'm offering something of value to this person, of course they would want it. Maybe they haven't yet seen the value in it. Maybe I didn't convey it properly or they just haven't got around to it. They're busy and that's OK. I'm still here. And the other one I wrote was finding things that recur daily and making them 2% better because daily things that you do, things you do with high frequency compound if you made them slightly better. And so this is where I think a lot of people are like, why are you optimizing for your shoes or your mattress or your pillow or whatever? Like I'm a stickler for how a meeting starts. I'm always like, no, no, no. At the start of every meeting, we say, all right, the purpose of this meeting is this, and a good outcome of this meeting would be, you know, why? If you can't say X and Y, like, we're not doing the meeting. I'll stop people, and I'll say, no, no, do this. Or when people talk, I'll be like, hey, you know, you're talking a really low voice and you're not sitting up straight Like could you just do it like say it with some energy? It'll make a difference and like but that's every meeting then people know that's how we do meetings And so once you teach me how we do meetings, we're gonna have a lot of meetings at this company. So we're gonna make them better. We're not just gonna have shitty meetings and let them slide. So finding recurring things and making them slightly better because it'll compound over time. So that was my-",no
"0:57:39 Shaan: he was definitely he had you know the hackers laziness which was like I'm not going to do something unless I'm unless it's clear that it's going to that it matters but I'm just going to do shit just to do shit that's the first thing second thing I'm not going to do the same thing every day. If I, if I'm doing it, if I have to do it multiple times, I'm automating this. And same thing, he would look around and be like, yeah, what's Sean do? What's Jason doing? Like are the non-technical people? And he'd be like, Hey, Neil, you see, Jason keeps what he's doing is he's going and finding each person manually on Twitter, you should just scrape this whole list, put it in a database and, And copy paste this code snippet so that he could put that on his machine so that he could just have his leads ready so he can go faster. He would do a lot of stuff like that. Like he told a story early at Apploven. So Apploven was a mobile ad tech company that is now worth billions of dollars. And he was the co-founder of it. And what Furkan told me a story. He's like, yeah, Adam, the CEO, he's like, one thing he really cared about was his dashboard. Like, what does our dashboard look like so that I have visibility? And he's like, I kind of watched Adam to see, like, is there really any value out of this? Or is he just, you know, sometimes CEOs just have pet projects. They just want to look nice. And he's like, is it that, or is there value here? So he shattered him. He's like, all right, I'm not going to sit on my computer. I'm sitting at your computer. You show me, what are you looking at with this dashboard? What do you do with it? And so he showed him and he's like, yeah, I do. I look at this, I look at this. And that tells me who we need to go after for these deals and I need to figure out how much to offer them so that I can get them faster. Like you know instead of just saying you should work with us for these features if I just make a monetary offer that's better than their current ad network they'll switch. And he's like okay so you need to figure out this list. You need this data and you need to know a projection of how much we can make with them. So you can offer less than that, but still more than what they're probably making for their current ad network. And I should just show you which what the current ad network is in this dashboard. I'll just figure that out by looking at their SDK, blah, blah, blah. And he looked, he basically put together this like command center for the CEO. And he's like, he basically built a sales tool rather than working on features of the product. He's like, I'm going to build you something. And what, so what they did was they would go to a developer. They say, You should use our ad network. And they're like, I already have an ad network. He's like, cool. I'm guessing your ad network pays you $9 CPM. And they're like, yeah, something like that. He's like, cool. We'll pay you $22. He's like, how can you do that? Don't worry. They aren't ad networks better. I consider it a conventional right now. It's better, but I'll just sign this paper that says we're already going to pay you $20 no matter what. Like I'm just confident it's going to perform because I know our ad networks better and they're like, okay, he's like, but here's the, you know, you got to switch and we have these two engineers standing here next to me. They're going to help you switch today. And then they would just, and they just rolled through the ad market because they were able to go to people and make them no brainer offers. How did they make them no brainer offers? Because they had this command center internally that was how big is this app? What are they currently using? How much are they currently making? How much do we think we can make off them? And then how do we have a spread there that we can work with? And so I thought that that was a great example of figuring out how to make the company successful in a way that most engineers would not do because most engineers just want to work on product and not even product, like the under the hood parts of the product, which is like even worse than making the product better.",yes
"1:00:55 Shaan: Because we weren't talking about like, CEOs fighting each other and shit.",no
1:01:17 Shaan: That's a good thing.,no
1:01:18 Shaan: Love that.,no
